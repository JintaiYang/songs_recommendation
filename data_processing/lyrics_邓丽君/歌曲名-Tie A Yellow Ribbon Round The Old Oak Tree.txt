Tie A Yellow Ribbon Round The Old Oak Tree
邓丽君
i'm comin' home, i've done my time
now i've got to know what is and isn't mine
if you received my letter telling you i'd soon be free
then you'll know just what to do
if you still want me
if you still want me
whoa, tie a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree
it's been three long years do ya still want me ?
if i don't see a ribbon 'round the old oak tree
i'll stay on the bus
forget about us put the blame on me
if i don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree
bus driver, please look for me
'cause i couldn't bear to see what i might see
i'm really still in prison
and my love.she holds the key
a simple yellow ribbon's what i need to set me free
i wrote and told her please please please
whoa, tie a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree
it's been three long years
do you still whant me?(still want me)
if i don't see a ribbon 'round the old oak tree
i'll stay on the bus
forger about us put the blame on me
if i don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree
now the whole darn bus is cheerin'
and i can't believe i see
a hundred yellow ribbons 'round the old oak tree
