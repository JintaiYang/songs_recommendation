而许多的恋情也都在夜晚发生
因为夜晚总是那么地浪漫，
据说有一首关于晚的情歌，
即使是全世界最酷的狗，听到了也会流露出哀伤的表情。
就让我带领各位进入这个神秘的夜晚
She's just sixteen years old
Leave her alone, they say
Separated by fools
We don't know what love is yet
But I want you to know
If I could fly
I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night
And show you love
Like you never seen, ever seen
It's like having　a dream
Where nobody hides a heart
It's like having it all
Watching it fall apart
And I would wait 'till the end
A time for you
And do it again it's true
I can't measure my love,
There's nothing to compare it to
But I want you to know
If I could fly
I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night
And show you love
If I could fly
I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night
And show you love
Like you never seen, ever seen
If I could fly
I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night
And show you love
If I could fly
I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night
And show you love
