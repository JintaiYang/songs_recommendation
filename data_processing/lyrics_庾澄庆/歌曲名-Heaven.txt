最后就让我们听这首......Heaven.
不论你在哪里
Oh thinkin about all our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free
now nothin can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me comin back for more
Baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin here in my arms
I'm findin it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven
once Oh in you life you find someone
Who will turn your would around
Bring you up when you're feelin down
Ya nothin could change
what you mean to me
Oh there's lots that I could say
But just hold me now
Cause our love will light the way
Baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin here in my arms
I'm findin it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven
I've been waitin' for so long
For somethin' to arrive
For love to come along
Now our dreams are comin' true
Through the good times and the bad
Ya I'll be standin' there by you
Baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin here in my arms
I'm findin it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven
Oh once in you life you find someone
I'm findin it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven
