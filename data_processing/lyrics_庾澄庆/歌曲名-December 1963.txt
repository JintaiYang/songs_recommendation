哇！我们听了那么多伤感的情歌
难道爱情总是那么悲伤
就没有比较快乐的一面吗？
错了！错了！
你该不会忘记了那双令你
情不自禁的......'Sexy Eyes'
或者那个难忘的夜，
在December 1963
Oh' What A Night.
Oh' what a night
Late December back in '63
What a very special time for me
As I remember what a night
Oh' What a night
You know I didn't even know her name
But I was never gonna be the same
What a lady
What a night
Oh I' I got a funny feeling
When she walking in the room
Oh my' as I recall it ended much too soon
Oh' what a night
Hypnoting mesmerizing me
She was everything I dreamed she'd be
Sweet surrender' what a night
I felt a rush
Like a rolling ball of thunder
Spinning my head around
And taking my body under
Oh' what a night
（RAP）
There's a lady I saw her walk ing down the street
At the night back in December 63
She moved like a beast
Sweet as a bee
She made my heart jumping inside out
She drove me crazy and it seemed so easy
I felt so lucky to meet the lady
I never（never） gonna（gonna） be so right
What a lady
What a night
What a night
