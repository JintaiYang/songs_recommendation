It's on my way
像一阵风掠过我身边
当你错身而过的瞬间
忽然间想要去很远
和你去看繁华世界
Imagination
It's on my way It's on my way now
Whatever it takes
Not for the destination
It's on my way It's on my way
All my colorful days
像一阵风掠过我身边
当你错身而过的瞬间
忽然间想要去很远
和你去看繁华世界
Imagination
It's on my way It's on my way now
Whatever it takes
Not for the destination
It's on my way It's on my way
All my colorful days
Imagination
It's on my way It's on my way now
Whatever it takes
Not for the destination
It's on my way It's on my way
All my colorful days
