It's cold cold world
I can't feel,I can't be real and now
I need something
maybe I gotta start up
hates become my only dollar
I can't move I can't see but with the devil I gotta barter
I am numb wanna drown in rum
wanna fill my lung cause I am so so heart-strong
my heart swollen and down I'm rolling
this hand up over the beast and death is looking golden now
总算是流干了眼泪
总算习惯了残忍
太阳每天都照常升起
在烂醉的清晨
像早前的天真梦想
被时光损毁
再没什么能让我下跪
我们笑着灰飞烟灭
人如鸿毛
命若野草
无可救药
卑贱又骄傲
无所期待
无可乞讨
命运如刀
就让我来领教
it's cold cold world
waking up in the morning my first thought is about my life
the same stress and strife
misery is my wife
cause I'm living in a club
nightmare and my soul is on death row but
I've sweating regret so I drink to forget
I must follow my fears on and up hill
battle down a dead and street
but now I'm smiling you know
I can't frown
I need air but I wanna drown
总算是流干了眼泪
总算习惯了残忍
太阳每天都照常升起
在烂醉的清晨
像早前的天真梦想
被时光损毁
再没什么能让我下跪
我们笑着灰飞烟灭
人如鸿毛
命若野草
无可救药
卑贱又骄傲
无所期待
无可乞讨
命运如刀
就让我来领教
人如鸿毛
命若野草
无可救药
卑贱又骄傲
无所期待
无可乞讨
命运如刀
就让我来领教
It's cold cold world
I can't feel,I can't be real and now
I need something
maybe I gotta start up
hates become my only dollar
I can't move I can't see but with the devil I gotta barter
I am numb wanna drown in rum
wanna fill my lung cause I am so so heart-strong
my heart swollen and down I'm rolling
this hand up over the beast and death is looking golden now
