王力宏 - Like A Gunshot
I'm about to go off like a gunshot
I wanna make you drip like a sweatshop
I'm about to make sounds that you never heard
Yeah I wanna take your locks
And break'em with the keys in your hand
Man it makes me high （It makes me high）
Lifts me to the sky （Yeah, yeah）
Love is just a lie （It's just a lie）
What made me so high （What made me so）
I have got to admit
This Homeboy, he won't quit
Makin' beats, talkin' shit
Spittin' fast, keepin' it
Session file, twenty-four bit
On the stage, is where I'm lit
All my fans, freakin' it
Jumpin' around, 'cause they won't sit
I'm talkin' 'bout body surfin'
Hands wavin', botties jerkin'
Some may dabble in the fountain
Of funk but as for us
We're already swimming in it
Man it makes me high （It makes me high）
Lifts me to the sky （Yeah, yeah）
Love is just a lie （It's just a lie）
What made me so high （What made me so）
Man it makes me high （It makes me high）
Lifts me to the sky （Yeah, yeah）
Love is just a lie （It's just a lie）
What made me so high （What made me so）
Man it makes me high （It makes me high）
Lifts me to the sky （Yeah, yeah）
Love is just a lie （It's just a lie）
What made me so high （What made me so）
