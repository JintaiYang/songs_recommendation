多么震撼的声音
来自全球各地
我们飘洋过海聚集在一起
这是精彩的较劲
激发彼此的潜力
无论输赢都是人类的胜利
气氛这么high 火力这么开
前后左右都是爱
I won't give up till I change your mind
Tell me baby
Why don't you just love me
Love me as I am
Why don't you just tell me
Tell me that we can
Why don't you just love me
I promise you that I will be the first to love you back
Simple as that
Why don't you just love
Why don't you just love
Why don't you just love
Why don't you just love
