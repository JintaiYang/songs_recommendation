王力宏- like a gunshot
come on come on
yeah
come on come on
yeah
come on come on
yeah
come on come on
yeah
i'm about to go off like a gunshot
i wanna make you drip like a sweatshop
i'm about to make sounds that you never heard
yeah
i wanna take your locks
and break'em with the keys in your hand
and a microphone in mine
man it makes me high （it makes me high）
lifts me to the sky （yeah, yeah）
love is just a lie （it's just a lie）
what made me so high （what made me so）
i have got to admit
this homeboy, he won't quit
makin' beats, talkin' shit
spittin' fast, keepin' it
session file, twenty-four bit
on the stage, is where i'm lit
all my fans, freakin' it
jumpin' around,'cause they won't sit
i'm talkin''bout body surfin'
hands wavin', botties jerkin'
some may dabble in the fountain
of funk but as for us
we're already swimming in it
