Chinatown, a world full of dreams
But opportunity isn’t as easy as it seems
You gotta rise up to the extreme and work like busy bee
Channel all your energy to fulfill your fantasies
City lights, what a sight crawling over the night
Shaped like bright fireflies and dragons with a bite
This is Chinatown nothing here is black or white
Fireworks ignite, this is a city that excites
Welcome to my world, Chinatown!  (唐人街!)
各个是高手, 又怎样?  (唐人街!)
要世界转我的方向  (唐人街!)
火力全开吶喊着梦想  (唐人街!) 向前闯
Working long nights but I’m acting brave
I am in charge of the road I pave
It’s time for me to complete this race
Finish out the day strong in first place
Here I go again in Chinatown doing my daily grind
Daily climb up to my apartment stairs I don’t mind
I just hope its a sign that if I try I will find
A place like this all the time
Everywhere, in all mankind
Welcome to my world, Chinatown!  (唐人街!)
各个是高手, 又怎样?  (唐人街!)
要世界转我的方向  (唐人街!)
火力全开吶喊着梦想 (唐人街!)  向前闯
Chi-na-town!
If you need to depart for a fresh start,
If you need to move to a new city
If you need to find a new committee, ask
Chi-na-town!
Welcome to my world, Chinatown!  (唐人街!)
各个是高手, 又怎样?  (唐人街!)
要世界转我的方向  (唐人街!)
火力全开吶喊着梦想 (唐人街!)  向前闯
Welcome to my world, Chinatown!  (唐人街!)
胆敢小看我的力量?  (唐人街!)
快放手一搏, 別傍徨  (唐人街!)
越战越勇气魄震全场  (唐人街!) 向前闯
