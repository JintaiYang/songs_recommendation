We don't talk anymore we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for
Oh we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
I just heard you found the one you been looking
You been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily
Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh it's such a shame
We don't talk anymore we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for
Oh we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for
Oh we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
是那处曾相见
是那处曾相见
We don't talk anymore we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for
Oh we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't talk anymore we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for
Oh we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
