Silently
 演唱：莫文蔚
 Im missing you Im feeling blue in the night
 with starry skies and starring eyes, shinning bright
 walking in your sleep with love you come to me silently
 silently you come away
 wont you stay another day
 silently you run away
 forever and ever
 how silently you took my love away
 Ill be waiting, Ill be praying
 for the day
 when you will learn and will return
 for always
 talking in your sleep
 of love you sing to me
 Heavenly
 silently you come away
 wont you stay another day
 silently you run away
 forever and ever
 how silently you took my love away
 silently you come away
 wont you stay another day
 silently you run away
 forever and ever
 how silently you took my love away
 silently you come away
 wont you stay another day
 silently you run away
 forever and ever
 how silently you took my love away
