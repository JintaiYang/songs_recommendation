Love For Sale
莫文蔚
When the only sound in the empty street
Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet
That belong to a lonesome cop I open shop
When the moon so long has been gazing down
On the wayward ways of this wayward town
That her smile becomes a smirk, I go to work
Love for sale, appetizing young love for sale
Love that's fresh and still unspoiled
Love that's only slightly soiled, love for sale
Who will buy? Who would like to sample my supply?
Who's prepared to pay the price, for a trip to
paradise?
Love for sale
Let the poets pipe of love in their childish way
I know every type of love better far than they
[ If you want the thrill of love, I've been through the
mill of love
Old love, new love every love but true love
Love for sale, appetizing young love for sale
If you want to buy my wares follow me and climb the stairs
Love for sale
Let the poets pipe of love in their childish way
I know every type of love better far than they
If you want the thrill of love, I've been through the
mill of love
Old love, new love every love but true love
Love for sale, appetizing young love for sale
If you want to buy my wares follow me and climb the stairs
Love for sale, love for sale, love for sale
