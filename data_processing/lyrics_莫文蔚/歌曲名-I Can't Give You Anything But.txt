I Can't Give You Anything But Love
莫文蔚
I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby.
Dream a while, scheme a while,
We're sure to find
Happiness and, I guess,
Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.
Till that lucky day you know darn well, baby,
I can't give you anything but love.
Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.
Till that lucky day you know darn well, my baby,
I can't give you anything
I can't give you anything
I can't give you anything but love
I can't give you anything but love
