莫文蔚 - PRETTY IN LOVE
BABY PLEASE PLEASE I DON'T WANNA PLAY WITH ANOTHER
I'M PRETTY & TOO MUCH IN LOVE
REMEMBER LONG LONG AGO WE'D BE DANCING FOREVER
AND FOREVER WAS NEVER ENOUGH
FOREVER TOGETHER IN LOVE
IN ALL MY IMAGINATION YOU ARE A TRUE FANTASY
THINKING OF YOU COMES SO EASILY
DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN MAKE ME FEEL HEAVENLY
WON'T YOU STAY A LITTLE LONGER PLEASE
EVERY TIME YOU PASS ME BYE
AND EVERY LITTLE THING I DO
I ONLY DO FOR YOU
I CAN'T DENY THAT I LOVE YOU
PLEASE PLEASE I DON'T WANNA PLAY WITH ANOTHER
JUST TRY TO IMAGING BEING WITH YOU IN PURE REVERIE
LOVING YOU MAKES LIVING SO EASY
I REMEMBER THE TIME WHEN WE WOULD KISS BREATHLESSLY
CAN WE LOVE LIKE HOW IT USED TO BE
