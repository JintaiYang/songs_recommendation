Stand next to me
I want to see you in this place
You are everywhere I look
As the light falls all around your face
Stay and take my hand
How many moments do we get
All is right in this world of ours
And time will go as time must go
Time won't undo what we both know
Where there is hope
There is a chance
That all our dreams will come to pass
Where there is hope
There is a chance
That all our dreams will come to pass
You are me
And I am you
同一个世界
同一个梦想
You are me
And I am you
同一个世界
同一个梦想
My name is hope
My name is love
同一个世界
同一个梦想
My love you are beautiful
You are saying that and I feel it's true
We have each other
And time will go as time must go
Time won't undo what we both know
Where there is hope
There is a chance
That all our dreams will come to pass
Where there is hope
There is a chance
That all our dreams will come to pass
You are me
And I am you
同一个世界
同一个梦想
You are me
And I am you
同一个世界
同一个梦想
Where there is hope
There is a chance
That all our dreams will come to pass
Where there is love
And then we can open our arms
And fly
one world one dream
