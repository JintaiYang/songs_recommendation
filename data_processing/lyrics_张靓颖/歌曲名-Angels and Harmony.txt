张靓颖：
Your energy controls my body
Take over me with just the silly way you say my name
Inside of me you're blazing fire
Your love is gasoline a flame that nothing can contain
When you hold me
Can't you hear them
Angels and harmony
They sing for us
Angels in harmony
Sing for our love
Angels in harmony
Ne-Yo：
Fortress of love we are
Impenetrable
Nothing can come between
Powerful is what we are
Said it's what we are
I feel the heavens smiling
Laying down upon us
Satisfied is the sun the moon and every single star
Every single star
When you hold me
Can't you hear them
The angels and harmony
They sing for us
Angels in harmony
Sing for our love
Angels in harmony
张靓颖：
And with heaven's approval
We'll do this forever you and me
The angels sing so beautiful
Sing so beautiful
Because the greater love could never be
They sing for us
Ne-Yo：
They sing for us
张靓颖：
Angels in harmony
Sung for our love
Both：
Angels in harmony
Angels in harmony
Ne-Yo：
Angels angels
Angels angels
Angels angels
Both：
Angels in harmony
