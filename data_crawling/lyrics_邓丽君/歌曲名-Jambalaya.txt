Good-bye joe, he gotta go, me oh my oh
He gotta go-pole the pirogue down the bayou

Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
Thibodaux, fontaineaux the place is buzzin'
A kin-folk come to see yvonne by the dozen
Dress in style the go hog wild, me oh my oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
Cause tonight, i'm gonna see my ma cher a mi-o
Pick guitar, fill fruit far and be gay-o
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
Settle down far from town get him a pirogue
And he'll catch all the fish in the bayou
Swap his mon to buy yvonne what she need-o

Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
Cause tonight, i'm gonna see my ma cher a mi-o
Pick guitar, fill fruit far and be gay-o
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
Cause tonight, i'm gonna see my ma cher a mi-o
Pick guitar, fill fruit far and be gay-o
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
Cause tonight, i'm gonna see my ma cher a mi-o
Pick guitar, fill fruit far and be gay-o
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
