Wise men say
only fools rush in
But I can't help
falling in love with you.

Shall I stay
would it be a sin
If I..I can't help
falling in love with you?

Like a river flows,
surely to the sea
Darling so it goes.
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand
take my whole life too
If I..I can't help
falling in love with you
Oh..

Oh..

Like a river flows,
surely to the sea
Darling so it goes.
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand
take my whole life too
If I..I can't help
falling in love with you
Oh.I...I can't help
falling in love with you
