  Every now and then
 When the world steps in
 Stealing all our time away
 It soon takes so much
 We forget to touch
 Thats when I know
 Its time for me to say
 Take my hand
 Lets walk through loves door
 And be free from the world once more
 Cares my heart
 We can hide today
 And love the world away
 
 Once again we'll be
 Where our hearts are free
 And the time is ours to share
 Love will always stay
 Just a touch away
 Come with me
 All the magic's waiting there
 Take my hand
 Lets walk through loves door
 And be free from the world once more
 Cares my heart
 We can hide today
 And love the world away
 We can love the world away
