When you left me all alone
 At the record hop
 Says that you are going out
 For a soda pop
 You were gone for quite a while
 Half an hour more
 You came back and on may oh
 This is what I saw
 Lipstick on your collar
 Says that you're untrue
 Lipstick on your collar
 Says that you're untrue
 Bet your botton dollar
 You and I are through
 'cause lipstick on your collar
 Told a tale on you
 Told a tale on you
