I'm gonna knock on your door, ring on your bell 
 Tap on your window too 
 If you don't come out tonight when the moon is bright 
 I'm gonna knock and ring and tap until you do 
 
 I'm gonna knock on your door, call out your name 
 Wake up the town, you'll see 
 I'm gonna hoot, hoot and howl like a lovesick owl 
 Until you say you're gonna come out with me 
 
 Hey little girl, this ain't no time to sleep 
 Let's count kisses stead of counting sheep 
 How, how can I hold you near 
 With you up there and me down here 
 
 I'm gonna knock on your door, ring on your bell 
 Tap on your window too 
 If you don't come out tonight when the moon is bright 
 I'm gonna knock and ring and tap until you do
