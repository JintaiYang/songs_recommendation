Oh! Carol I am but a fool
Darling I love you
Don't you treat me cruel
You hurt me
And you made me cry
But if you leave me
I will surely die
Darling there will never be another
Cause I love you so
Don't ever leave me
Say you'll never go
Darling I will always want you for my sweetheart
No matter what you do
Oh! Carol
I'm so in love with you
Oh! Carol I am but a fool
Darling I love you
Don't you treat me cruel
You hurt me
And you made me cry
But if you leave me
I will surely die
Darling there will never be another
Cause I love you so
Don't ever leave me
Say you'll never go
Darling I will always want you for my sweetheart
No matter what you do
Oh! CarolI'm so in love with you
