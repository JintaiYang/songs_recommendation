I love Rock N' Roll
So put another dime in the jukebox
Baby
I love Rock N' Roll
So come and take your time and dance with me
I saw him dancing there by the record machine
I knew he must have been about seventeen
The beat was going strong
Playing my favourite song
And I could tell it wouldn't be long
Until he was with me
Yeah, Me
And I could tell it wouldn't be long
Until he was with me
Yeah, With me
Singin'
I love Rock 'N Roll
So put another dime in the jukebox
Baby
I love Rock N' Roll
So come and take your time and dance with me
I love Rock 'N Roll
So put another dime in the jukebox
Baby
I love Rock N' Roll
