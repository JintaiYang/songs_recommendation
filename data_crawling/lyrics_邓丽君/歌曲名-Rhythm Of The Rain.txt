Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
Telling me just what a fool I’ve been
I wish that it would go
and let me cry in the rain
And let me be alone again
The only girl I care about has gone away
Looking for a brand new start
But little does she know
that when she left that day
Along with her she took my heart
Rain please tell me now does that seem fair
For her to steal my heart away
when she doesn’t care
I can’t love another
when my heart’s somewhere far away
