craig david - for once in my life
for once in my life
i have someone who needs me
someone i've needed so long
for once unafraid
i can go where life leads me
and somehow i know i'll be strong
for once i can touch
what my heart used to dream of
long before i knew
someone warm like you
could make my dream come true
for once in my life
i won't let sorrow hurt me
not like it's hurt me before
for once i've got someone
i know won't desert me
i'm not alone anymore
for once i can say
this is mine, you can't take it
as long as i've got love
i know i can make it
for once in my life
i've got someone who needs me
could make my dream come true
for once in my life
i won't let sorrow hurt me
not like it's hurt me before
for once i've got someone
i know won't desert me
i'm not alone anymore
for once i can say
this is mine, you can't take it
as long as i've got love
i know i can make it
for once in my life
i've got someone who needs me baby
