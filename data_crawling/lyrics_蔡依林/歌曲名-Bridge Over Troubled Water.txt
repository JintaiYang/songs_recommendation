When you're weary,feeling small,
When tears are in your eyes,
I will dry them all
I'm on your side.
When times get rough
And friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down.
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down.
When you are down and out
When you're on the street,
When evening falls so hard
I will.fort you.
I take your part
When the darkness.es
And pain is all around.
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down.
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down.
Sail on silvergirl,Sail on by,
Your time has.e to shine.
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine.
If you need a friend.
I'm sailing right behind.
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down.
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down.
Yes I'll,yes I'll Lay me down.
