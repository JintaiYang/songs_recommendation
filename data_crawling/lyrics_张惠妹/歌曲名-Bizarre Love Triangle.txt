Every time i think of you
I get a shot right through
Into a bolt of blue
It`s no problem of mine
But it`s a problem i find
Living the life that i can`t leave behind
There`s no sense in telling me
The wisdom of a fool won`t set you free
But that`s the way that it goes
And it`s what nobody knows
And every day my confusion grows
Every time i see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I`m waiting for the final moment
You say the words that i can`t say
I feel fine and i feel good
I feel like i never should
Whenever i get this way
I just don`t know what to say
Why can`t we be ourselves like we were yesterday
I`m not sure what this could mean
I don`t think you`re what you seem
I do admit to myself
That if i hurt someone else
Then i`ll never see just what we`re meant to be
Every time i see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I`m waiting for the final moment
You say the words that i can`t say
Every time i see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I`m waiting for the final moment
You say the words that i can`t say
Every time i see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I`m waiting for the final moment
You say the words that i can`t say
Every time i see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I`m waiting for the final moment
You say the words that i can`t say
Every time i see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I`m waiting for the final moment
You say the words that i can`t say
Every time i see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
