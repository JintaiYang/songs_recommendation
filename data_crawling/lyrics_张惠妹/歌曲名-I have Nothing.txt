Share my life take me for what I am
cause I'll never change
All my colors for you
Take my love I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are and everything that you do
I don't really need to look very much further
I don't want to have to go Where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again this passion inside
Can't run from myself there's no where to hide
don't make me close one more door
i don't want to hurt anymore
stay in my arms
if you dare
must i imaging you there
don't walk away from me
i have nothing nothing nothing
if i don't have you
you...
you see through right to the heart of me
you break down my wals with the strength of your love
I never knew love like i've known it with you
whether memory survive
one i can hold on to
I don't really need to look very much further
I don't want to have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold if back again this passion inside
can't run from myself there's no where to hide
your love i remember-forever
don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
stay in my arms
If you dare must i imaging you there
don't walk away from me
i have nothing nothing nothing
don't make me close one more door
i don't want to hurt anymore
stay in my arms
if you dare must i imagine you there
don't walk away from me no
don't walk away from me no
don't you dare walk away from me
i have nothing nothing nothing
