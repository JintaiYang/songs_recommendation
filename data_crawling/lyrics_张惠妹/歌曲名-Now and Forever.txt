Whenever im weary form the battles that rage in my head
You make sense of madness when my sanity hangs by a thread
I lose my way but still you seem to understand
Now and forever i will be your girl
Sometimes i just hold you
Too caugh up in me to see
Im holding a fortune that heaven has given to me
Ill try to show you each and every way i can
Now and forever i will be your girl
Now i can rest my worries and always be sure
That i wont be alone anymore
If id only known you were there all the time
All this time

Until the day the ocean doesnt touch the sand
Now and forever i will be your girl
Now and forever i will be your girl
