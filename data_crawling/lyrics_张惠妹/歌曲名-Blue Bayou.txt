I feel so bad I got a worried mind
I`m so lonesome all the time
since I left my baby behind on blue bayou
saving nickels saving dimes
working till the sun don`t shine
looking forward to happier times on blue bayou
I`m going back some day
come what may to blue bayou
where the folks are fine
and world is mine on blue bayou
where those fishing boats
with their sails float
if I could only see
that familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes
how happy I`ll be

gonna see my baby again
gonna be with some of my friends
maybe I`ll feel better again on blue bayou
saving nickels saving dimes
workimng till the sun don`t shine
looking forward to happier times on blue bayou
I`m going back some day
come what may to blue bayou
where the folks are fine
and world is mine on blue bayou
where those fishing boats
with their sails float
if I could only see
that familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes
how happy I`ll be

oh that boy of mine by my side
the silver moon and the evening tide
oh some sweet day going to take away
this hurting inside

well I`ll never be blue
my dreams come true
on blue bayou
