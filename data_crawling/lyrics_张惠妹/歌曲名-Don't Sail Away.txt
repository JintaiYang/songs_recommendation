作词 : KUMAR, KEVIN/KUMAR, SEAN
alone
On a sailboat lost at sea
I did not recognize the skies above me
My compass was just spinning round and round
It was just spinning round

And then with a gust of wind things changed
Set off one course that seemed to me quite strange
I was heading through the air straight for the the monn
Straight for the the monn

And when I landed
He took my hand
We dinedang we danced with the stars

He asked me to stay in this dreamland
But the wind called out so I went instead
Then he turned to me and said

Don`t sail away
Don`t sail away from me
Don`t sail away
We could have such a lovely time

Don`t sail away
Don`t sail away from me
Don`t sail away
You could stay and just be mine
I told him not this time

The wind carried me across deep spaces
I visited many times and many places
I drived until my boat can to a stop
On destiny`s roof top

In side
I played chess with destiny
I saw a way to win so very easily

But he was taking far too long to make his move
Destiny wouldn`t move

So I turned my boat
Back towards that dreamland
And I filled the sails with my breath

When I landed
He took my hand
Though the wind called out I remained instead

He still turned to me and said
Don`t sail away
Don`t sail away from me
Don`t sail away
We could have such a lovely time

Don`t sail away
Don`t sail away from me
Don`t sail away
You could stay and just be mine
I like to stay for a life time
Don`t sail away
Don`t sail away
I like to stay
Don`t sail away
 could have such a lovely time
Don`t sail away
Don`t sail away
Don`t sail away
could stay and just be mine
