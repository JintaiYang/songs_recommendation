WHAT'S UP

And I say hey...
I say hey What's going on.
And I say hey
I say hey What's going on
25 years of my life and still.
I'm trying to get up that great big hill of hope.
For a destination.
I realized quickly when I knew I should.
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man.
For whatever that means.
So I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed.
To get it all out what's in my head.
Then I start feeling a little peculiar.
So I wake in the morning and I step outside.
I take a deep breath I get real high.
Then I scream from the top of my lungs What's going on.
And I try, oh my god do I try.
I try all the time
In this institution.
And I pray, oh my god do I pray.
I pray every single day For a revolution.
