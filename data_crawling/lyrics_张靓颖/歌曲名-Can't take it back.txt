dont't know where to begin
i just can't pretend
i've been holding this in
afraid to lose a friend
but i let it slip when i fell all over you
last time we met and now
the word is out
i can't take it back  no  no
it's out in the open
i told you everything
now i wait till i know how you feel
don't ask me to act  go on
like nothing has happened
now that i gave my heart away like that
i can't take it back

well it's out of my heart
and in your hands
as the hourglass drops its final grain of sand
i'm holding out hope that stars in your eyes are gonna
fall for me at last
i take the chance
i can't take it back no no
it's out in the open
i told you everything
now i wait till i know how you feel
don't ask me to act go on
like nothing has happened
now that i gave my heart away like that
i can't take it back
i let down my guard
and i'll have to carry on
i've gone too far
i can't take it back no  no
it's out in the open
i told you everything
now i wait till i know how you feel
don't ask me to act go on
it's out in the open
i told you everything
now i wait till i know how you feel
don't ask me to act go on
it's out in the open
i told you everything
now i wait till i know how you feel
