Maybe I'm not enough

I can't give you what you need anymore

Maybe it's just my luck

That I got less than what I bargained for

So if what you feel is no longer real
I can just walk away

But don't leave me hangin'

If you're unsure no more back and forth

Can you help me

Tell me what I'm fighting for

Please just tell me

You can be honest if I'm fighting on my own

I can't live if I'm on this battlefield alone

Maybe I'm not as tough as I used to be

It's getting to be too much

I would rather you just set me free

So if what you feel is no longer real

I can just walk away

But don't leave me hangin'

If you're unsure no more back and forth

Can you help me

Tell me what I'm fighting for

Please just tell me

You can be honest if I'm fighting on my own

I can't live if I'm on this battlefield alone

Like a battlefield

I'm on this battlefield alone

Battlefield alone
