You always mind what I say
but I say what's on my mind
Always complain about my love
but I think you just love to complain
Please don't act apologetic
boy you look so pathetic
now that everything's falling apart
Should've stopped for just a minute
before you pushed me to the limit
Now it's too late to win back my heart
I bet you wish you could take it all back
should've seen this is coming
You never thought that I really had
power of a woman
Should have loved what you had as much as you said
instead of try to change who I am
Now just take it like a man

You never let me be me so I just went along
You left me when I was weak
but now that I am strong
I don't care what you think
I don't care what you say
and I am gonna do things my way
And I'm here to let you know
that you gotta let it go
there ain't no way
I gonna stay
I bet you wish you could take it all back
should've seen this is coming
You never thought that I really had
power of a woman
Should have loved what you had as much as you said
instead of try to change who I am
Now just take it like a man.
Just Take it like a man

Seems you have the misconception
love's just physical attraction
never care to know what I'm all about
You had every chance to show me
That you meant the things you told me
and I wonder if anything was true,yeah~~~
I bet you wish you could take it all back
should've seen this is coming
You never thought that I really had
power of a woman
Should have loved what you had as much as you said
instead of try to change who I am
Now just take it like a man.
Just Take it like a man
The power of woman
Just take it like a man
