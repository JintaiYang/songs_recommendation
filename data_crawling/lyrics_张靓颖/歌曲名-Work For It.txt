Shock my body
Light up the fire
Can you ignite it
Turn up the flame on it
Get it started
Pull me in close
I want you on me
Show me why you want it
Walk up to my session and you know I'm turning heads
Got your eyes all on me but
You too proud to beg
You keep throwing signs
But I'm not a psychic
If you really want it
Better get it if you can
You keep sending me signals
It's like that subliminal
My body's talking without words
I know you feel it too
Elephant in the room
The energy's coming through
But Ima make you work for it
But Ima make you work for it
But Ima make you work for it
Aaa work for it
Aaa work for it
Aaa but Ima make you work for it
Aaa work for it
Aaa work for it
Aaa but Ima make you work for it
Temperature's rising
I feel the heat
Somebody hit the siren
Turn up the flame on it
Get it started
You're all I need
I want you on me
Show me why you want it
Walk up to my session and you know I'm turning heads
Got your eyes all on me but
You too proud to beg
You keep throwing signs
But I'm not a psychic
If you really want it
Better get it if you can
You keep sending me signals
It's like that subliminal
My body's talking without words
I know you feel it too
Elephant in the room
The energy's coming through
But Ima make you work for it
But Ima make you work for it
But Ima make you work for it
Aaa work for it
Aaa work for it
Aaa but Ima make you work for it
Aaa work for it
Aaa work for it
Aaa but Ima make you work for it
