Just had a bad day
Had car trouble on the highway
And my stupid boss don't like me
Spilled hot coffee on my blue jeans
I'm low on money
And it ain't funny
But it's still sunny outside
So I keep on smiling
I won't start wailing
I just keep living my life
Can't keep me down me down
It's only temporary
Can't make me frown me frown
So I ain't even worried
'Cause the world keep spinning
Life goes on and on
I won't cry for long
I won't cry for long long long
'Cause it still be winning
When things are going wrong
I turn on my favorite song
And dust my shoulders
Dust my shoulders off
Dust my shoulders off
Dust my shoulders off
I don't worry 'bout nothing just dust it off
Dust it off
Dust my shoulders off
Dust my shoulders off
Dust my shoulders off
I don't worry 'bout nothing just dust it off
You can't find your girlfriend
Your boyfriend left you
But the party's still going on
Everybody here saying
Dust your shoulders off
See 'em kissing in the kitchen
By bathroom
Butcha don't let it phase you
Go hit the bar up
Go and key his car up
Tell him that it's karma
Can't keep me down me down
It's only temporary
Can't make me frown me frown
So I ain't even worried
'Cause the world keep spinning
Life goes on and on
I won't cry for long
I won't cry for long long long
'Cause it still be winning
When things are going wrong
I turn on my favorite song
And dust my shoulders
Dust my shoulders off
Dust my shoulders off
Dust my shoulders off
I don't worry 'bout nothing just dust it off
Dust it off
Dust my shoulders off
Dust my shoulders off
Dust my shoulders off
I don't worry 'bout nothing just dust it off
I ain't tripping over drama
All about my numbers
Tell 'em get up outta my face
You don't even know me
You don't even know me
Save it for another day
I ain't tripping over drama
All about my numbers
Tell 'em get up outta my face
You don't even know me
You don't even know me
Save it for another day
No big deal
Win some you lose some
But life gets real
Won't last forever
Won't last forever
Come on
'Cause the world keep spinning
Life goes on and on
I won't cry for long
I won't cry for long long long
'Cause it still be winning
When things are going wrong
I turn on my favorite song
And dust my shoulders
Dust my shoulders off
Dust my shoulders off
Dust my shoulders off
I don't worry 'bout nothing just dust it off
Dust my shoulders off
Dust my shoulders off
Dust my shoulders off
I don't worry 'bout nothing just dust it off
