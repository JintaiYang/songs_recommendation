谁让记忆凋谢

孤独漫向毁灭

Love me love me

Love me love me
荒诞的理由

When they push me like this

谁能救赎我灵魂的残缺
让爱复苏在明天的明天

问一遍又一遍
Who who

They talk about about about about you

They talk about about about about you

Who who

They talk about about about about you

They talk about about about about you

救我 救我

救我 救我

还有谁更胆怯

没底线的妥协

Help me help me

Help me help me
多无聊的理由

When they killed me like that

谁能救赎我灵魂的残缺
让爱复苏在明天的明天
问一遍又一遍
Who who

They talk about about about about you

They talk about about about about you

Who who

They talk about about about about you

They talk about about about about you

救我 救我

黎明之前的魇
Who

救我 救我
They talk about about about about you

They talk about about about about you
