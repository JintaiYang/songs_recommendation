Saw you called yes I’m busy
Saw your note said you missed me
No use trying no use in denying
It’s over now you should move on
Say you’re here I’m okay now
Say you care it’s too late now
Talk is useless I’m past your excuses
Why can’t you see that I’m gone
Bet you thought you played me
Now you actin crazy
I don’t care anymore
Funny when you lost me
you cried on my shoulder
Tryna say you’re sorry
when it’s already over
Have you had enough count
your time it’s up

I don’t wanna see you
and no I’m not jaded
No I don’t need you
and don’t you just hate it
Just get out of sight
and get out of my mind
Just get out of my life

Got your text can’t text back now
No more stress so relaxed now
It’s behind me
so don’t try and find me
It’s over now you should move on
Out with friends I’ll be home late
Yes he’s here it’s not your place
What’s it to you
I’ll do what I want to
Why can’t you see that I’m gone
Bet you thought you played me
Now you actin crazy
I don’t care anymore
Funny when you lost me
you cried on my shoulder
Tryna say you’re sorry
when it’s already over
Have you had enough count
your time it’s up
I don’t wanna see you
and no I’m not jaded
No I don’t need you
and don’t you just hate it
Just get out of sight
and get out of my mind
Just get out of my life

Can’t you see that
I’m happy without you
I don’t need you
so just leave me alone
Funny when you lost me
you cried on my shoulder
Tryna say you’re sorry
when it’s already over
Have you had enough count
your time it’s up
I don’t wanna see you
and no I’m not jaded
No I don’t need you
and don’t you just hate it
Just get out of sight
and get out of my mind
Funny when you lost me
you cried on my shoulder
Tryna say you’re sorry
when it’s already over
Have you had enough count
your time it’s up
I don’t wanna see you
and no I’m not jaded
No I don’t need you
and don’t you just hate it
Just get out of sight
and get out of my mind
Just get out of my life
