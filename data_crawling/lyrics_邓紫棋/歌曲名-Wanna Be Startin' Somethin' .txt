I took my baby to the doctor
With a fever, but nothing he found

You love to pretend that you' re good
When you' re always up to no good
You really can' t make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone' s always tryin' to keep my baby cryin'
Treacherous, cunnin' , declinin'
You got my baby cryin'
