when i see you walking down the street
i get so shaky and i feel so weak
i tell my eyes look the other way
but they don't listen to a word i say
and i go to pieces and i wanna hide
go to pieces and i almost die
everytime my baby passes by

i tell my arms to hold someone new
another love that will be true
but they don't listen, they don't seem to care
they reach for her but she's not there
and i go to pieces and i wanna hide
go to pieces and i almost die
everytime my baby passes by

i remember what you said
when you said goodbye baby
we'll meet again soon may be
but until we do all my best to you
i'm so lonely i think about you only

i go to pieces we used to go
but i know you'll never show
you hurt me so much inside
how i hope you're satisfied
and i go to pieces and i wanna hide
go to pieces and i almost die
everytime my baby passes by

go to pieces and i (and i die)
go to pieces and i (wanna hide)
go to pieces and i, my baby
