Emmaneul thinks about the girl
He knows all too well
Shes got him a tangle
And shes got him in her spell
She dances with his mind
And she dances on the floor
And she knows how to drive him
So lo-co

Emmanuel knows shes trouble
But what else can he do
shes got him round his finger
With her different points of view
She can dance away her troubles
Shes danced into his life
she got him working hard for him
In all night!

Emmanuel seen it all
But no like this before
A girl who turns up the heat
By walking through the door
And when she hits the dance
she burns up all the lights
Shes the one and only one thing
In his sight
emmanuel just doesnt know.
where this all is gonna lead
he only know what he wants
and what he really needs
he needs to know
what makes her tick
and know all her games
he knows no other woman
be the same
