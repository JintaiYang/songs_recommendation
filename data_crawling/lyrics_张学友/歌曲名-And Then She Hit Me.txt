7:35 i came to life and threw my pants on
and i searched for shoes to fit the groove to get my dance on to
take a ride into town down on main street where
a friend of mine was playing live down at rbc's
but girlfriend is taking so long
hogging the bathroom and the phone
then she had the nerve to say the words that i should click and go
and don't change the mood wiht attitude and i said...
you should talk
right then i knew i blew it right then i stepped into it
i knew that i would need a drink to get through it
she just turned aroud and smiled...
and then she hit me and then she hit me
we walked in at half past ten and the place was jacked
cut the casualties and made a bee line for the bar
surprised i made it cause the leash it only goes so for
long islands in my system i felt like sonny liston
by the second round i was going to town and she was in her coat
i said i will find a ride tonight but baby you can go
right then i knew she blews it i found her drama anusing
she took another drink and must've said screw it
and she just turned around and smiled
i know i drive her crazy
i bring out her best and worst
it's not her fault she loves me but
it's all my fault when she gets hurt
right i knew she lost it
she drew line and i crossed it
i was drinking like it's water from fauset
and i just turned around and smiled....
and then she hit me
