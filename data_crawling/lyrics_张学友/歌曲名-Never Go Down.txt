Never Go Down

Alone in the city Ain't no streets of gold
Wallowing in self pity
In a world so hard and cold
Walking the streets in vain
To find a friendly face
But all I got was pain
And I was lost without a trace
Scared and alone
I didn't have the strength to carry on
I thought that I would never win this fight
Took solace in my loneliness
But now I see the light
Coz-l-oh l-oh l
I'm never going down again
I said I-oh-l l-oh-l
I'm never going down again
I've danced with the devil
I have prayed to the Lord
Drewned in a sea of sorrow
My joie da vivre was overboard
Too many broken hearts
So much gone undone
But I'm trying to find the spark
And all the darknee overcome
Looked to the sky
I was searching for salvation from on high
But hope springs eternal like true love
And I made a vow somewhere somehow
That I would rise above
Coz l-oh-l oh-l
I'm never going down again
I said I-oh-l l-oh-l
I'm never going down again
I'm never going down again
