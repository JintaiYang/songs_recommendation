作词 : DAVE PICKELL
When you're lost and the light is fading
The wind blows cold and you can't find your way back home
Remember that the darkest hour is just before the dawn
Sometimes a leap of fauth is all it takes
Cause only love can see the path to set you free
Just close your eyes, look inside, and let your heart believe
There's been a force so strong beside you all alone
You'll know it when your dream comes true
There's something only love can do
In your quest for a new horizon
Set your course find a star to light your way
Although the task may seen sometimes to be more than you can bear
One thing you need to know you are not alone
Cause only love can see the path to set you free
Just close your eyes, look inside, and let your heart believe
There's been a force so strong beside you all alone
You'll know it when your dream comes true
There's something only love can do
If you believe in miracles then you can be the one
To shine you light and show the world
There's nothing love can't overcome
Cause only love can see the path to set you free
Just close your eyes, look inside, and let your heart believe
There's been a force so strong beside you all alone
You'll know it when your dream comes true
There's something only love can do
There's something only love can do
