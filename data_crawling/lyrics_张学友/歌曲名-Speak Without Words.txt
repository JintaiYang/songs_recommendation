I can feel the night upon my skin and I can't sleep
You know I want you you know I want you
I can feel the fire my desire burns so deep
I need to love you to feel you want me too
And I never knew I could love you this way
And I want you more than I ever could say
Don't make me wait baby do it again
Over and over again
Yours lips speak without speak without words
I can feel you deep inside of me
Feel my body sweetly lose controls
Speak without Speak without words When we kiss I feel the mystery
Touch my body and my soul
In the velvet silence I reach out to your skin
And there is magic in every part of me
When I hear your voice inside my head and I begin
To understand your secret poetry
And I never knew I could love you this way
And I want you more than I ever could say
Please baby please baby do it again Over and over again
And I never knew it could last so long
I'm gonna do everything that you want
Tonight oh baby, just reach out
