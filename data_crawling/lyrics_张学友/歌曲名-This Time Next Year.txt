Tonight you say
that I'm your one
You caress me tender
Until the morning comes
The sound of your whisper
Ringin' inside my ear
I want to hear those usame sweet words next year ooh
So many lovers, other lovers came and gone
Makin promises forever only till the
Next one comes along
So why don't you tell me
Why don't tell me
This time next year
Will you still love me
Or will I be losing you
Why don't tell me
This time next year
After all the ups and downs
And you gonna be around
Don't ever leave me
Don't ever go away
Just tell me I got nothin' to fear
Baby this time next year
I love you so
With all of my heart and soul
Don't wanna lose you
Don;t want this love so grow old
Not much am I askin
All I want is you
I feel you inside my heart
With every little thing you do
