It's hard to sleep at night
when you're lonely
It's hard to get a date
when you're homely
If I could I spit inmy face
Hey baby please can I get your number?
Cause losers like me are so much funner
She told me, " can't we just be friends?"
She could have mentioned that before she let me in
I shave my head I take a bath
My clothes are cool but they still laugh
I don't get luck
I feel so lame Boy
Yea....
I bet you probably wished you never met me
But I'd gladly kiss your brown eyes if you let me
We might as well go and have some fun
Because I know that you're gonna dump you when you're done
I ask you once
I beg you twice
I don't get stone and
I don't have lice You
say it ain't me "Please understand..."
That you like hime
and you don't like me
I ask you out
It never fails You're too busy painting your mails
I feel so lame I am so ashamed Boy
do I got it made
It's hard to sleep at night when you're lonely
It's hard to get a date me so homely
What I Got It Made
