Holding you in my lonely night
Waiting for you to heal your wound
Dreamt we were soaring in the sky
Why is it so hard

I turned to you and braved my heart
You gave me hope but stood so still
Missing your shape out of thin air
Foolish we are

You don't know why I carry on
You don't know happiness is unbound
You took me here and made me strong
Then sudden farewell without a word
I know your heart is nearly here
But all my fears you're so unaware
I caught your lies found them everywhere
Try not to care
No one knows my heart

No one does just one thing in life
No love can fly and never fall
I used to be proud of our trust
Now full of loss then

Or should I go on with broken parts
Taking memory as coming stars
I hope I can be here without doubt
Better yourself

You don't know why I carry on
You don't know happiness is unbound
You took me here and made me strong
Then sudden farewell without a word
I know your heart is nearly here
But all my fears you're so unaware
I caught your lies found them everywhere
Try not to care
No one knows

You don't know why I carry on
You don't know happiness is unbound
You took me here and made me strong
Then sudden farewell without a word
I know your heart is nearly here
But all my fears you're so unaware
I caught your lies found them everywhere
Try not to care
No one knows my heart
