everything that you are
and everything that you do
fills me with hope and love
i want you to know that i love you
thoughts of you fill my mind
and brighten up every day
my dreams of a perfect love
coming true in so many ways
and i know i can't be wrong
to say that together we belong
and think of the times
we've seen each other through
tell me if the song
should ever get weary or too long
that everyghing will calm
 as long as i have you

your kisses are just like sumshine
melting away the winter snow and
suddenly life awakens
reminding me you're the best woman i know
and i know i can't be wrong
to say that together we belong
and think of the times
we've seen each other through
tell me if the song
should ever get weary or too long
that everyghing will calm
 as long as i have you
tell me if the song
should ever get weary or too long
that everyghing will calm
 as long as i have you
