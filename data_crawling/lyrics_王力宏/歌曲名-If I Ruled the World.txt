Tony Bennett:If I ruled the world
Every day would be the first day of spring
Every heart would have a new song to sing
And we'd sing of the joy every morning would bring.
Leehom Wang:If I ruled the world
Every man would be as free as a bird
Every voice would be a voice to be heard
Take my word we would treasure each day that occurred.
Together:My world would be a beautiful place
Where we would weave such wonderful dreams
Leehom Wang:My world would wear a smile on its face
Like the man in the moon has when the moon beams.
If I ruled the world
Every man would say the world was his friend
Tony Bennett:There'd be happiness that no man coud end
No my friend, not if I ruled the world.
Together:Every head would be held up high
There'd be sunshine in everyone's sky (和：蔚蓝的天空都有阳光）
If the day ever dawned（和：若有明天.....） 合：when I ruled the world
