When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see

I won't be afraid,
no I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand,
stand by me

And darling, darling
When I play my guitar
On the comer of the street
For the people
who don't know where to be

If my hands should grow tired
I'll still sing my song
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me
And darling darling
Stand by me oh stand by me
Oh stand now stand by me
Stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry no I won't cry
No i won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

And darling darling
Stand by me oh stand by me
Oh stand now stand by me
Stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble
Won't you stand by me
Oh stand by me
Oh now stand now stand by me
Stand by me

And darling darling
Stand by me oh stand by me
Oh stand now stand by me
Stand by me
