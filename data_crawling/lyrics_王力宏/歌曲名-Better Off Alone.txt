if i was the north wind
would you stop and shoot the breeze
and if i was a mirror
you would get close as you could be
if i was a candle
would you hold me gently
but if i was to love you
oh, you would run away from me

（yes you would）
the water in the most

was high to help protect the queen
and i was on the other side
with a drawbridge in between
i waited at the gate
but you were never to be seen
and bridges burn much easier
if you'er using kerosene

（heh, heh, heh…）

and i would hold my own
just to ascend that throne
though all my friends at home tell me i'm
better off alone
and all the tales you told

about true love got old
cause in the end
you showed me how your
love was so, so cold, baby……ow

seven days a week
i call you just to hear you say:
" boy, i've got a thing for you
but there really is no way. "
even so i know you love me
more and more each day
you tell me i'm the only one
when your boyfriend is away（oh no）

and i would hold my own
just to ascend that throne
though all my friends at home tell me i'm
better off alone

and all the tales you told
about true love got old
cause in the end
you showed me how your
love was so, so cold, baby……ow
