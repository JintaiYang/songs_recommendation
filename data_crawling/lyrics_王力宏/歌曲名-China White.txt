Listen
I got a feeling someone's gonna get hurt
Yeah Yeah
Selling your soul for a bag full of purified dirt
It's gonna stretch your diamond rings to sell to
psurie street
And it's all over when the fat lady sings
You're stupid selling up the neighbourhood
You've pick the wrong place, brother, for dealing your goods
You're going down fool, I promise you that
I'll hit you twice, even for you can flinch, that's afact
Coz you are punking, coming into my town
I've got no patience for you
I don't care how many guns you got
Coz I got Kung Fu and a badge
I'll be wooping your ass
From Shanghai to LA
China White China White, I'm gonna take you down
China White China White, And I'll be messing 'round
China White China White, Before my chance is gone
China White China White, Come on Come on
Coz you've been killing since the day you've born
Offering good times bought and sold like a whore
How many innocents will share your disease before you
You took the mother from an innocent child
Under the covers left her body defiled
And now you're showing up my part of town
I wanna take you down
Take you down
I got a feeling someone's gonna get hurt
Selling your soul for a bag full of purified dirt
It's gonna stretch your diamond rings to sell to
And it's all over when the fat lady sings
You're stupid selling up the neighbourhood
You've pick the wrong place, brother, for dealing your goods
You're going down fool, I promise you that
I'll hit you twice, even for you can flinch, that's afact
Coz you are punking, coming into my town
I've got no patience for you
I don't care how many guns you got
Coz I got Kung Fu and a badge
I'll be wooping your ass
From Shanghai to LA
China White China White, I'm gonna take you down
China White China White, And I'll be messing 'round
China White China White, Before my chance is gone
China White China White, Come on Come on
China White China White, Nobody's gonna stop me, man
China White China White, man, I'm seeing this shit
China White China White
China White China White
China White China White
