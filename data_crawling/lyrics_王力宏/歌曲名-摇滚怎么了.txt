我刷了四个和弦 天下太平
面带敏君的笑容 挂得僵硬
理性和感性无法谱成歌曲
我没写任何有意义的歌词
一声傲笑声音在飘woah

what's wrong with me
wro-o-nong with me
我还相信爱怎么那么奇怪
what's wrong with me
wro-o-nong with me
我还相信人
i must have a problem

感情世界风起风停没预订
吉他提琴琵琶二胡全走音
我想吐 bleho 查不出任何毛病
医师诊断还是些无病呻吟
冰河消失连你也无声无息
人世间太多太多太多不确定
what is wrong with me
wro-o-ong with me
我还相信爱
怎么那么奇怪
what is wrong with me
wro-o-ong with me
我还相信人
i must have a problem
一声傲笑声音在飘woah
what's wrong with me
wro-o-nong with me
我还相信爱怎么那么奇怪
what's wrong with me
wro-o-nong with me
我还相信人
i must have a problem
