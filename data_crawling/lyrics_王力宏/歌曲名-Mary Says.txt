How long has it been
since I held you near?
How long will it be
till I have you right here?
You say that it hurts
I can't disagree
But how can I hold on
to someone who's leaving me?
And Mary says she's gonna be OK
She tells me things are getting busier these days
And Mary says she's gonna be alrignt
You know how much I miss her in my life
Goodbye yesterday,
I see my dreams walking away
And Mary looks just like she did before
Except she don't love me
she don't love me amymore
I could shake your hand
or I could kiss you goodbye
But I just might break down
looking in your brown eyes
So what happens next
do I listen to my mind or heart?
I don't know where to start
feeling alright again...
And Mary says she's gonna be OK
She tells me things are getting busier these days
And Mary says she's gonna be alrignt
You know how much I miss her in my life
Goodbye yesterday,
I see my dreams walking away
And Mary looks just like she did before
Except she don't love me
And Mary says she's gonna be OK
She tells me things will be much easier someday
And Mary says she's gonna be alrignt
You know how much I'm missing her deep inside
And Mary says she's gonna be OK
She tells me things are getting busier these days
And Mary says she's gonna be alrignt
