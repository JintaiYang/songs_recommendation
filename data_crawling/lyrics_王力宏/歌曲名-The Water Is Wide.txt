The water is wide
I can't cross over
And neither have
I wings to fly
Give me a boat
that can carry two
And both shall row
my love and I
There is a ship
and she sails the sea
She is loaded deep
as deep can be
But not so deep
as the love I'm in
I know not how
I sink or swim
Oh love is handsome
and love is kind
and love is flower
when first it's new
But love grows old
and wax is cold
and fades away
like morning dew
