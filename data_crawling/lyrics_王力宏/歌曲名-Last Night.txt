I watched you sleep as you lay there
I dropped to my knees and said a prayer
I leaned over softly to kiss your beautiful face
But I could not cross the ocean of your grace
The moonlight held you a loft a picture of peace
The only sound was the soft breeze form the east
My heart beat down in my chest To the rhythm of your gentle breath
And the whole world calmed down
For this moment of rest
Now I'm….I'm standing above you trying so hard no To tell you I love you
And all that I want in this world is you
If you'd only wake up
You'd know I was true
Oh baby
I love you can be so hard to say
Especially when it's meant in this strong a way
But at this moment while you lie sleep
I am suddenly free
And my trembling arms reach out for you
As if you could see
Now I'm ….I'm standing above you trying so hard not to tell you I love you
And all that I want in this world is you
If you'd only wake up
you'd know it was true
If you'd only wake up
you'd know it was true
