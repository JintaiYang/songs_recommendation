just can't live just can't die
你似乎看见大楼阴影复活包围过来
自由到不自在期待的色彩都成了黑白
谁是你的朋友谁是你的真爱
究竟你想要证明些什么
woo yeah
你的一切脆弱我心里明白
我只想要立刻带你离开
you can get out get out get out of your nest
you don't have to be the one
you can get out get out get out of your nest
you don't have to be the best

自由到不自在一切成了黑白
自由到不自在一切成了黑白

早晨的报纸晚上变成垃圾满街覆盖
一半已经昏迷努力的叫另一半醒来
你想发现什么想知道什么
没有人能够给你答案
woo yeah
你的一切脆弱我心里明白
我只想要立刻带你离开
you can get out get out get out of your nest
you don't have to be the one
you don't have to be the best
you can get out get out get out of your nest

just can't live just can't die
没有人能够给你答案你想发现什么
