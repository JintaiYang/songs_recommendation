I keeps it versatile cause that's my style
From hip-hop to be-bop I been with shorties around the world Variety
is just my personality Sometimes
I just don't fit in
I see the open doorways But no one wants to let me in
Grandma made me understand material things don't make the man
Try to find that inner wealth and learn to love yourself
Lately it's so hard to find peace of mind
I just got to get away
from the haters and the instigators
The mis-conceivers and the non-believers
People don't believe the hype 'cause Leehom ain't no stereotype
No Crystale in the tub Or
iced out Spreewell dubs
I'm really not your average thug
Not your average gangster
And I won't be defined by the size of my knot But the state of my mind
No Rolex on my wrist Or platinum on my chest
'Cause I don't need that shit to impress
But y'all don't get it twisted
I got love for the ghetto
Tho I'm not your average thug
（Feel me）
Lord I been around the world
Sangin' near and far
People runnin'game all over
Judgin’ me before we meet when they see me on the street
And they don’t know a damn thing about me
It’s a world of jealousy deceit and envy
Seems like everybody tryin’ to take something from me
Grandma made me understand material things don’t make the man
So I found the inner wealth and learned to love myself
Lately it’s so hard to find peace of mind （lately it is so hard）
I just got to get away from the haters and the instigators
There’s back-stabbers and money-grabbers, users and abusers
And they all wear smilin’ faces
No Crystale in the tub Or iced out Spreewell dubs
I'm really not your average thug
Not your average gangster
And I won't be defined by the size of my knot But the state of my mind
But y'all don't get it twisted
I got love for the ghetto
Tho I'm not your average thug

Sometimes I feel like I’m gonna snap
and go off up in this piece on somebody
I ain’t tryin’ to say no names
but I ain’t trying to play no games
Holla if you feel me people
So lift me up in a lonely world that’s so unkind
There’s back-stabbers and money-grabbers, users and abusers
And they all wear smilin’ faces
No Rolex on my wrist Or platinum on my chest
I'm really not your average thug
'Cause I don't need that shit to impress
Not your average gangster
And I won't be defined by the size of my knot
But the state of my mind
No Crystale in the tub Or iced out Spreewell dubs
No Rolex on my wrist Or platinum on my chest
'Cause I don't need that shit to impress
But y'all don't get it twisted
I got love for the ghetto
Tho I'm not your average thug
