You with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged
Oh I realize
It's hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
And the darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small
But I see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful
Ooh,like a rainbow

Show me a smile then
Don't be unhappy,can't remember
When I last saw you laughing
And that's why I love you
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there
And I'll see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful
Ooh,Like a rainbow

So sad eyes
Take  courage
Oh I realize
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
Just call me up
Because you know I'll be there
And I'll see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
True colors
True colors
True colors is shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
True colors
True colors are beautiful
Like a rainbow
