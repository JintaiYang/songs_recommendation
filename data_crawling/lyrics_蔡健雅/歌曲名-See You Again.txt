作曲 : 蔡健雅
Hey I don't think I got your name
Don't even know where you stay
Where you stay

Oh hey
Don't you think it might be fate?
How we met on a boring day
Yeah it's fate

I don't know whether if I'd ever see you again
But I'd sure like to try to see you once again
Whether if we would make it as lovers or friends
I wish on a star
So I could see you again

Hey I think about you everyday
Say my prayers say my grace
Say them loud loud
Ooh hey
Can't forget your handsome face
It's a sweet and bitter taste
Sweet and bitter taste
I don't know whether if I'd ever see you again
But I'd sure like to try to see you once again
Whether if we would make it as lovers or friends
I wish on a star
So I could see you again

I don't know whether if I'd ever see you again
But I'd sure like to try to see you once again
Whether if we would make it as lovers or friends
I wish on a star
I don't know whether if I'd ever see you again
But I'd sure like to try to see you once again
Whether if we would make it as lovers or friends
I wish on a star
So I could see you again
So I could see you again
So I could see you again
Whether if we would make it as lovers or friends

I wish on a star
So I could see you again
