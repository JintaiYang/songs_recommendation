My friend I know youll be there if Im feeling blue
My friend even though were worlds apart
And you think you havent got the style
To stand alongside superstars
My friend even though how everything turned out wrong
My friend after all its just a passing phase
Youre not the only one to belleve
That you deserve a damn much better life
So you can say what you want
Let yourself be free let your heart guide you Cry if you want
I wont desert you I wont be far
My friend no one knows me well like how you do
My friend always up for the long conversations
About my indecisions in love
My erratic moods youre hart to find
My friend I know I ll be there if youre feeling blue
My friend even though were worlds apart
We might be walking in two directions
But we know where each is heading to
So you can laugh all want
Let yourself be free I wont let you down
Do what you want
Live out your big dreams Id understand
Say what you want
Let yourself be free let your heart guide you
Cry if you want
I wont desert you I wont be far away
