I looked around for life
For something to hold me back in time
Yearning, waiting to
Break into the silence of the night
A thousand troubled lies
Trapped within truth and confusion
Forgive me
Maybe for the words I chose to say
If I should fall
Into your arms
Would I feel insecure
Im so far away
But too close so you say
Funny why we make peace and love
Once again theres nothing to feel
Im sheltered from the light
Hiding behind this shady vision
Holding the wind
I hate to think that you wont be there anymore
Im in love with you in every waking hour
Every now and then you move me
Im in love with you in every waking hour
All the ashes in my eyes
Dont you know that I love you I love you
And I want to
So if you are thinking of running away
Let me run with you
