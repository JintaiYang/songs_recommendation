Drunk on my sobriety
Driven by your insanity
Made to stumble in my formative years
Could have sworn it was my perversion
Care to spare me a minute
Could i be alone for awhile
Fortunately you were out of my way
Could have sworn it was my possession
Until next time
Until next life
Never knew youd hurt me
Now you crave for sincerity
Thought we d be around for twenty long years
So its just imagination
Was it bad now really
When the sex has lost all its charm
Whos to blame for putting up with the fight
So its just to my elation
Until next time
Until next life
I ll wear my clothes right
I ll sleep on the other side
I ll say whats necessary
Until next time
