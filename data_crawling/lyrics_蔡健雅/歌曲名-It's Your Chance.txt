作曲 : it's your chance
have you thought it over
have you gotten what you deserve
was it off your shoulders
were you relieved to know that everything worked out
have you gotten over
have you started a brand new life
have you met somebody
someone who's ordinary someone unlike me
cos now its your chance to do what you wanna do there's no time to waste

the day is still young the world waits for no one
what are you waiting for the times la la la........
