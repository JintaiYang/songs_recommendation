Sorry  wasn't  good  enough
A  song  without  meter  and  rhyme
A  long  forgotten  promise  I  recalled  I  made  to  you
A  candle  flame  dies  in  the  wind
It  looks  like  it's  about  to  rain,about  to  rain
Spirals  from  your  cigarette
Your  sweet  colgone  on  my  pillow
Messages  you  left  me  still  sing  like  some  lullaby
Pretty  pictures  on  the  wall
Hopes  in  us  will  rise
And  in  the  rain,in  summer  days  too
When  the  willow  tree  weeps  too
Under  street  light  so  bright
I'll  rememeber  you  everyday
The  plane  leaves  in  an  hour's  time
Hold  me  till  our  last  goodbye
Silence  is  the  only  sound
No  words  can  speak  it  through
I'll  breathe  your  breath  for  one  last  time
You'll  be  strong  and  so  will  I,so  will  I
Chorus:
And  in  the  rain
In  summer  days  too
When  the  willow  tree  weeps  too
Under  street  lights  so  bright
I'll  remember  you
I'll  remember  you
I'll  remember  you
Everyday
