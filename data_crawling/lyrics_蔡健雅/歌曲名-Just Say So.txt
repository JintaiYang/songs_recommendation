You've got a way
Ooh a devious way
But I'm telling you I'm not a child
I'm tired of playin this silly game
So why can't you
won't you make up your mind
If you love me
Tell me that you do
And just hold me tight
No more lies
If you love me
Do what any man would have done
Make it right
Cos love ain't
Something to be taken so easily
Like a casual pastime
So if you love me baby
Love me baby love me baby
Why don't you just say so
Why don't you say so
Are we or aren't we on the same page
I've been contemplating for a while
Cos haven't we been better than okay
Yet I'm stuck here
With a million whys
If you love me
Tell me that you do and
Just hold me tight no more lies
If you love me
Do what any man would have done
Make it right
Cos love ain't
Something to be taken
So easily like a casual pastime
So if you love me
Baby love me baby love me baby
Why don't you just say so
Why don't you say so

Oh is there someone else
Oh is there?
I thought that we were done
Working that out
Well I've made up my mind
That you're the one for me
This time I know for sure
But I can't help but wonder
If you love me
Tell me that you do
And just hold me tight, no more lies
If you love me
Do what any man would have done
Make it right
If you love me
Tell me that you do
And just hold me tight, no more lies
If you love me
Do what any man would have done
Make it right
Cos love ain't
Something to be taken
So easily like a casual pastime
So if you love me baby
Love me baby love me baby
Why don't you just say so
Why don't you say so
