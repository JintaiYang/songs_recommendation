Late at night
Thoughts run wild
Dreams alive
Streets are empty
But you never thought that I d
Be sleeples over you
Cant Believe
What yoy put me through
Hate to say
Thought you shauld know
Im in trouble so bad
Youre put my life on hold
Youre playing hard to get, yes yes
So can you tell me more yes yes
I ll make do with your yes yes
Wake me up
When its fine
When youre gone
I ll start over
Maybe cos the timings wrong
I cant see through it all
I wont leave till you say
Late at night
Thoughts run wild
Dreams alive
Streets are empty
youre playing hard to get yes yes
Wake me up
tell me more than your yes yes
When itsfine
I ll make do with your yes yes
When youre gone
I ll make do with your yes yes
I ll start over
I ll make do with your yes
