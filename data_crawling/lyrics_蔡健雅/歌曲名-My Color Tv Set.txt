wish i had a colour tv set
i'd sit around all day
and kick my shoes off anywhere
what is it about those pretty boys?
i wish they'd come alive
and bring some colour to my room
la la la......
wish i had a colour tv set
i'd sit around all day
and let the day turn into night
funny people playing up today
what a joke it is
for them to see me from their screen
la la la......
i wake in the morning just to see the sun
look out the window to see people passing by
but nothing! just nothing!
i think about the things to do
i think about my colourful sweet baby
music......
wish i had a colour tv set
stay up late at night
don't care what happens there and then
i'm sick of people knocking at the door
just me my tv set
will stick together through the times
la la la......
