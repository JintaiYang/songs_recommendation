The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I'd never dreamed that I'd need somebody like you
I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you

No, I don't want to fall in love
No, I don't want to fall in love
..with you

What a wicked game you played
to make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do
to let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say
you never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do
to make me dream of you
No, I don't want to fall in love
No, I don't want to fall in love
..with you

The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I'd never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you

No, I don't want to fall in love
No, I don't want to fall in love
..with you

No, I...

Nobody loves no one
