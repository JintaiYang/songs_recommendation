I say
Pretty Baby Oh Pretty Baby
What's Come Over?You look weary today.
Kinka weary Like a child at play
I see no reason for regrets or dismay
What I say I never ever say it in an ordinary fashion
What I do I do with total passion
Listen to my cries Look into my eyes
Lucky lady Oh lucky lady
I have a feeling of success on the way
Never easy On a rainy day
I take no comfort in the games that you play
What I say I never ever say it in an ordinary fashion
What I do I do with total passion
Listen to my cries Look into my eyes
I say I'll play I'll lay
down my rules before you turn away
and I swear I dare To share
all my love if only you would do as I say
（music）
Lovely lady Oh lovely lady
What is the secret to success all the way
A little beauty Goes a long way
It conjures up the little trick that I play
What I say I never ever say it in an ordinary fashion
What I do I do with total passion
Listen to my cries Look into my eyes
I say I'll play I'll lay
down my rules before you turn away
and I swear I dare To share
all my love if only you would do as I say
（music）
I say I'll play I'll lay
down my rules before you turn away
and I swear I dare To share
all my love if only you would do as I say
I say I'll play I'll lay
down my rules before you turn away
and I swear I dare To share
all my love if only you would do as I say
