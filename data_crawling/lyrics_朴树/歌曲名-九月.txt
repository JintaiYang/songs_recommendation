北风从今夜开始吹起
我的心灯火闪闪忽明忽暗
怎么说起又怎能说清这漫长迷茫的夏季
当那聚会要散去时该谁远行谁不醒
And time pass by
And time pass by
看这就是让我迷失的那座城市
舞步如梦恍惚
醉的人们呀举起杯笑着眼里都是泪
谁在晚餐后老去像迷雾里我的心
My life is in mud
My life is in mud
Can you help me?
Can you help me?
Can you help me?
Can you help me?
Can you hear me?
Can you stop me?
Do you believe me?
Can you feel me?
So far so near
So you lead me
Can you hear me?
Can you stop me?
Do you believe me?
Can you feel me?
So far so near
So you lead me
Can you lead me?
Can you lead me?
Can you lead me?
Can you lead me?
Can you lead me?
Can you lead me?
Can you lead me?
Can you lead me?
