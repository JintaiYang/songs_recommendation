Yeah …
Cring   on   my   pillow   lonely   in   my   bed
Then   I   heard   a   voice   beside   me   and   she   softly   said
Wonder   is   your   night   light
Magic   is   your   dream
And   as   I   held   her   she   said   see   what   I   mean
I   said   what
She   said   ooh   ooh   ooh   wea
I   said   All   right
She   said   love   me   love   me   love   me
