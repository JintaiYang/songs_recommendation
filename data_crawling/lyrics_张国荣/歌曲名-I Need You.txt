we used to laugh we used to cry
 we used to bow our heads then wonder why
 but now youre gone i guess ill carry on
 and make the best of what youve left to me
 left to me left to me
 i need you like the flower needs the rain
 you know i need you guess ill start it all again
 you know i need you like the winter needs the spring
 you know i need you i need you
 and every day id laugh the hours away
 just knowing you were thinking of me
 and then it came that i was put to blame
 for every story told about me
 about me about me
 i need you like the flower needs the rain
 you know i need you guess ill start it all again
 you know i need you i need you
 i need you like the winter needs the spring
 you know i need you guess ill start it all again
 you know i need you i need you
 i need you like the flower needs the rain
 you know i need you guess ill start it all again
 you know i need you i need you
 i need you like the winter needs the spring
 you know i need you guess ill start it all again
 you know i need you i need you
 i need you like the flower needs the rain
 you know i need you guess ill start it all again
 you know i need you i need you
 i need you like the winter needs the spring
 you know i need you guess ill start it all again
