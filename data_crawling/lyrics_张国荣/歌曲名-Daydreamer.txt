i remember april when the sun was in the sky
and love was burning in your eyes
nothing in the world could bother me
cause i was living in the world of made believe
but now you got
i'm just a daydreamer
walking in the rain chasing after rainbows
i'm in never fine again
life is much too beatiful
to live it all i know
oh how much i need someone to go my very own
Now the summer's over
and I find myself alone
with only memories of you
I was so in love that I couldn't see
cause i was living in the world of made believe
but now you got
i'm just a daydreamer
walking in the rain chasing after rainbows
i'm in never fine again
life is much too beatiful
to live it all i know
oh how much i need someone to go my very own
i'm just a daydreamer
oh oh......
ah ah......
