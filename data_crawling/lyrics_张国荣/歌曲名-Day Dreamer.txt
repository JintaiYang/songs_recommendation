张国荣 - Day Dreamer
词曲： Terry Dempsey
专辑：Day Dreamin'
I remember April when the sun was in the sky
Love was burning in your eyes
Nothing in the world could bother me
Cause I was living in a world of ecstasy
But now you're gone
I'm just a daydreamer,walking in the rain
Chasing after rainbows I may never find again
Life is much too beautiful to live it all alone
Oh how much I need someone to call my very own

Now the summer is over
and I found myself alone
With only memories of you
I was so in love, I couldn't see
‘Cause I was living in a world of make believe
But now your gone
I'm just a daydreamer,walking in the rain
Chasing after rainbows I may never find again
Life is much too beautiful to live it all alone
Oh how much I need someone to call my very own
I'm just a daydreamer,walking in the rain
Chasing after rainbows I may never find again
Life is much too beautiful to live it all alone
Oh how much I need someone to call my very own
I'm just a daydreamer,walking in the rain
Chasing after rainbows I may never find again
Life is much too beautiful to live it all alone
Oh how much I need someone to call my very own
I'm just a daydreamer baby
oh oh oh......
