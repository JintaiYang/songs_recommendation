Tonight and forever ,
Tonight and forever.
It's just another night another day,
Your  heart is still so far away.
I need to be near,
I never  thought that I would feel this way.
But now I know that I am  sure.
I wish you were here.
I wanna be here right by your side.
I wanna be the only one.
Can I hold you tonight and forever.
Baby, It doesn't matter where you are,
We will never be apart.
I'll be there, Tonight and forever.
It doesn't matter where you stay,
I will hold you anyway in my heart,
Tonight and forever.
Tonight and forever.
And everytime that you are by my side,
My heart is written oh so clear.
I feel like a child.
So hear me out and
Please don't get me wrong.
I do believe that we belong together my love.
I wanna be here right by your side.
I wanna be the only one.
Can I hold you tonight and forever.
Baby, It doesn't matter where you are,
We will never be apart.
I'll be there, Tonight and forever.
It's doesn't matter where you stay,
I will hold you anyway in my heart,
Tonight and forever.
I should have told you, but I didn't know how.
Wish I was holding you now.
Tonight and forever, Tonight and forever.
Where you are, doesn't matter.
We won't be apart,
Tonight and forever.
Where you stay.
I will be there with you anyway.
Tonight and  forever.
It doesn't matter where you are,
We will never be apart.
I'll be there, Tonight and forever.
It doesn't matter where you stay,
I will hold you anyway in my heart,
Tonight and  forever,
Tonight and forever.
Tonight and forever.
