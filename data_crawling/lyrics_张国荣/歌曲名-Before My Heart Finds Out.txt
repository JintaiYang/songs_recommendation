Well, you woke me from a dream about you
Just to say that you were leaving
I'm sleepy but I thought that you said that our love
That will last forever is ending
Well, before you walk out of my life
Would you be especially quiet?
And don't you let my heart know that you're leaving
Don't you say another word about it, darling
Don't you let my heart hear your footsteps
Walking out the door of my hopes and dreams
And don't you let my heart know that you're leaving
Don't you say another word about it, darling
Leave me now before my heart finds out
Well, I see you writing something down
And leaving it on the dresser
And the tears in your eyes look a lot like mine
But I guess it's all for the better
Well, before we say our last goodbye
Baby, won't you hold me just one more time?
And don't you let my heart know that you're leaving
Don't you say another word about it, darling
Don't you let my heart hear your footsteps
Walking out the door of my hopes and dreams
And don't you let my heart know that you're leaving
Don't you say another word about it, darling
Leave me now before my heart finds out
Leave me now before my heart finds out
