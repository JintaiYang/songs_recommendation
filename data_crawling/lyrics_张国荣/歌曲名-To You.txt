作曲 : 周治平
In the rain I'm standing here
I'm all alone and missing you
I never want to let you go that you go that way
In the rain I’m all alone
Running in the rain for you
I wanna give my life to you to you
I remember the days when we were happy and so gay
I remember the days we lived in perfect harmony
For so many times I let you down
so many times I made you cry
Never meant to be that way I only want to say
For so many times I let you down
so many times I made you cry
Never meant to be that way I only want to send
Send my love to you
