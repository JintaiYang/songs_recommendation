I heard the music coming
Fainly thro the wall of an old cafe
I was fellin' kinda restless
And drifted t'wars the noise it was the end of the day
Thro the down down the hall
The sound I heard thro the wall was getting near
So I grabbed a sent and ordered a drink
And was surpised that they was play'in my favourite thing
They were singing that old unforgetable pistol packin' melody
It's a true that set me singing
And the rhythm they were playing
Justa made me want to live
They were singing that old unforgetable pistol packin' melody
And it tingles up a feelin
And sets my heart a feelin
And it mades me want to live
And run home
And write the same kinda thing on my own
Sometimes it's hard to get up and write a sentimental song
Sometimes you want to create such magic
Today I want to compose a rose
That makes ya feel like I did at the old cafe
So here's my contribution to ya all
Hope it does the same thing to ya all
When you hear it thro the wall
Here's my old unforgettable pistol packing melody
Hope it's a tune that sets you swinging
And the rhythm they're playing
Justa makes you want to live
Here's my old unforgettable pistol packing melody
Hope it tingles up a feeling and sets your heart a reeling
And it makes you want to live and run home
And write the same kinda thing on your own
They were singing that old unforgettable pistol packing melody
It's a tune that set me singing
And the rhythm they were playing
They were singing that old unforgettable pistol packing melody
Justa makes me want to live
And it tingles up a feeling and sets my heart a reeling
And it mades me want to live
And run home and write the same kinda thing on my own
They were singing that old unforgettable pistol packing melody
It's a tune that set me singing
And the rhythm they were playing
Justa made me want to live
They were singing that old unforgettable pistol packing melody
And it tingles up a feeling and sets my heart a reeling
And it mades me want to live
And run home and write the same kinda thing on my own
