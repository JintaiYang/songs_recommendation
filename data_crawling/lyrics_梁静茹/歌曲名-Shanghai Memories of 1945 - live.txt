I'm wondering how I came to be here
Lying alone trying hard not to shed a tear
Remember daddy said “boys don't stay for long”
They always think that there's something wrong
I open up my eyes and I see
Little reminders of when you're here with me
I'm hooked to the telephone
Please you've got to call
I know you never promised anything at all
Shanghai memories of 1945 I don't cry I don't cry
Shanghai memories of 1945 I don't cry I don't cry

My last two weeks go by and I stay
All alone in my room with no-one all day
You  must realize you will never see
Life could be good if you only stayed with me
Shanghai memories of 1945 I don't cry I don't cry
Shanghai memories of 1945 I don't cry I don't cry
Shanghai memories of 1945 I don't cry I don't cry
Shanghai memories of 1945 I don't cry I don't cry
Shanghai memories of 1945 I don't cry I don't cry
Shanghai memories of 1945 I don't cry I don't cry
