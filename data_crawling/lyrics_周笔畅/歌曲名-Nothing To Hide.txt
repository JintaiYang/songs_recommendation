Come on out now I have the words to say

Never a doubt you would be the one to get away

Knowing me I would be the one left behind

Perfectly now I know to say what's on my mind

And now I know what I wanna do

Do do do your worst

Coz I've got nothing left to hide from you

Do do do your worst

Coz I've got nothing left to hide from you

I got nothing to hide

I got nothing to hide from you

I got nothing to hide from you

I got nothing to hide from you

Whatever you like now you get to have your say

On the tip of my tongue now you've turned your back on me

Honestly it never seems to be worth my while

Energy wasted on you now I'm in denial

And now I know what I wanna do

Do do do your worst

Coz I've got nothing left to hide from you

Do do do your worst

Coz I've got nothing left to hide from you

And after all is said and done

We breathe it out and I'll move on
No room for hanging on to what could be

The moment's passed so now we're free

Do do do your worst

Coz I've got nothing left to hide from you

Do do do your worst

Coz I've got nothing left to hide from you

I got nothing to hide

I got nothing to hide from you

I got nothing to hide from you

I got nothing to hide from you
