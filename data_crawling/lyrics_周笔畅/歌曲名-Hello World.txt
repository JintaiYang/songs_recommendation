 Hey, morning and kiss the world
 Put on my little shiny skirt
 Happen to meet a dog
 who gave me a spit of the tongue
 I’m singing on the road
 Wish I would never grow old
 and summer time would never go
one two one two three go
 Hello my world hello your world
 Every time when I saw your face
 Won’t you please send me a smile
 and dance with my toe
 Hello small world hello big world
 Wanna give my love to everyone
 but this time I’d keep it deep in my soul
