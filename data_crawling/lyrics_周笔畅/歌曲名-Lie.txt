I was a puppet on your strings

And all I wanted was your love

I gave you all that I could give

But even that wasn't enough

The heart is so vulnerable
You picked me up to watch me fall
Left me broken every time

You deceived  and I believed

Foolish me  but now I see
Every word you brought to life
Was a lie

Lie
Lie

The heart is so vulnerable
You picked me up to watch me fall
Left me broken every time

You deceived and I believed

Foolish me  but now I see
Every word you brought to life

Was a lie

Why didn't you give me your heart

Instead you played pretend

I put my all in from the start

I can't believe this is the end
