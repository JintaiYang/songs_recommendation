I`m That Girl

浏览几世纪  美丽被人设计了

别人怎麽说管他的  灵魂是我的
复制着流行  那不是我的风格

I won't die a copy girl. I was born original.
标准是自己定的  自信是你的
不需要谁指挥我们该怎麽快乐

我来决定～面对这世界的角色
Cause
I`m That Girl That That Girl
I`m That Girl Like no one else
I`m That Girl That That Girl ah ah ah ah
I`m That Girl That That Girl
I`m That Girl Like no one else
I`m That Girl That That Girl ah ah ah ah
I`m That Girl

把复杂还原  公式全部晾在一边

创造你魅力的无限  呼吸就漏电
不被谁局限  自然是最佳导演

I won't die a copy girl
I was born original
感动是自己找的  不是要来的
不需要谁告诉我们怎样才值得
你来决定～面对这世界的角色

Cause I`m That Girl That That Girl
I`m That Girl Like no one else
I`m That Girl That That Girl ah ah ah ah
I`m That Girl That That Girl
I`m That Girl Like no one else
I`m That Girl That That Girl ah ah ah ah
I`m That Girl

The spotlight is flashing

All the beat is crashing

Cause
I`m That Girl That That Girl
I`m That Girl Like no one else
I`m That Girl That That Girl ah ah ah ah
I`m That Girl That That Girl
I`m That Girl Like no one else
I`m That Girl That That Girl ah ah ah ah
I`m That Girl That That Girl
I`m That Girl Like no one else
I`m That Girl That That Girl ah ah ah ah
I`m That Girl That That Girl
I`m That Girl Like no one else
I`m That Girl That That Girl ah ah ah ah
I`m That Girl 我爱我

I`m That Girl 谁懂我

I`m That Girl 就是我

I`m That Girl 最懂我

I`m That Girl
