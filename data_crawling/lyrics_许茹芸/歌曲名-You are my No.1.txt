I've kissed the moon a million times
Dancd with angels in the sky
I've seen snowfall in the summer time
Felt the healing of the powers above
世界之大我在什么地方
越想你越接近海洋

你的唇凝聚着月光


吻着我狂烈的幻象


I've even seen miracles

I've felt the pain disappear

But still haven't seen anything


That amazes me quite like you do
You bring me up when I'm feeling down

I'll do it for you
You touch me deep you touch me right

Just for you
You do the things I've never done

You make me wicked you make me wild

Cause baby baby

You're My No 1



I've sailed in a perfect dream

I've seen the sun make love to the sea
I've kissed the moon a milion times
Danced with angels in the sky
I've even seen miracles
I've seen the tears disappear
But still haven't seen anything
That amazes me quite like you do

You bring me up when I'm feeling down

I'm crazy for you
You touch me deep you touch me right

I'll chase the blues away
You do the things I've never done


You make me wicked you make me wild
Cause baby baby

You're My No 1







You bring me up when I'm feeling down

I'll do it for you
You touch me deep you touch me right

Just for you
You do the things I've never done

You make me wicked you make me wild
You bring me up when I'm feeling down

I'm crazy for you
You touch me deep you touch me right

I'll chase the blues away
You do the things I've never done

You make me wicked you make me wild

So why
Cause baby
You're My You're My No 1
