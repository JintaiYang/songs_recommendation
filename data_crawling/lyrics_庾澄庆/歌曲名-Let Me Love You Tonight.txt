Dark clouds are blowing in the wind

He's crossing your mind again

You got that sad sad feeling from a broken heart

Feeling so close to the end
Let me love you tonight

There's a million stars in the sky

Let me love you tonight

I'll make everything all right

When you find out how good love can be

You're so lost when in such a free

They say once in your life you find someone that's right

Someone who loves you like me

Let me love you tonight

There's a million stars in the sky

Let me love you tonight

I'll make everything all right

When the moon has forgotten what the night about

And the stars get word the place is out

Hold me tighter than tight
When the daylight comes and feel all right

Let me love you tonight

There's a million stars in the sky

Let me love you tonight

I'll make everything all right

Let me love you tonight

There's a million stars in the sky

Let me love you tonight

I'll make everything all right

Let me love you tonight

Let me love you tonight

Let me love you tonight

Let me love you tonight
