She was lonely and no one really cared
 Just a prisoner of a love that was unfair
 She really wanted him but he was never there
 Now she's looking for a lover for the lonely nights to share
 
 The midnight light shining from the window
 The loving light keeps me glowing inside
 The midnight light brightens up the shadow
 
 First time lovers it'll never be the same
 I was losing but still I play the game
 She looked right through me like no one ever dared
 She said meet me at midnight
 Cause I'm lonely and I'm scared
 
 The midnight light shining from the window
 The loving light keeps me glowing inside
 The midnight light brightens up the shadow
 
 I feel so sorry when I hold you tight yea
 Cause I know I'm holding a lover for the night
 
 The midnight light shining from the window
 The loving light keeps me glowing inside
 The midnight light brightens up the shadow
 
 Keep the light on baby
 Keep the light on baby
 You know I'm coming to love you
 Keep the light on baby
