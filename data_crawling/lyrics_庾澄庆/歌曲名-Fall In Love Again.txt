Baby, baby, falling in love
I'm falling love again
Baby, baby, falling in love
I'm falling love again
I could never see
What fate'd planned for me
And then you came
And made my dream it meant reality
Maybe you can see
All the things you've meant to me
My simple fate is at the gate
And girl you've got the key
Baby, baby, falling in love
I'm falling love again
Baby, baby, falling in love
I'm falling love again
It seems like yesterday
You and I first loved this way
But now I know that love can grow
With each and every day
It's pretty late at midnights hour
And feel loves hidden power
So strong and bole
As life unfolds a mystery to me
Baby, baby, falling in love
I'm falling love again
Baby, baby, falling in love
I'm falling love again
You and me fore eternity
In love we'll always be
Young and free and naturally
The way it's gotta be
Baby, baby, falling in love
I'm falling love again
Baby, baby, falling in love
I'm falling love again
Baby, baby, falling in love
I'm falling love again
Baby, baby, falling in love
Baby, baby, falling in love
I'm falling love again
Baby, baby, falling in love
I'm falling love again
