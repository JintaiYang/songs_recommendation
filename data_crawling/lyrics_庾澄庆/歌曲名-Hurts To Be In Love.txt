More and more
your kiss feels like a half opened door
I can't get in
You stop me just before I begin
And it hurts to be in love
When you never really get enough
Oh it hurts to be in love
Send this search
Keeps my body right on the verge
We touch and then
I wanna to do it over again
And it hurts to be in love
when you only want me have as much
Oh it hurts to be in love
I always worried
You think I'm pushing too hard
Baby it hurts me
When you tell me
I'm going too far
We touch and then
I wanna to do it over again
And it hurts to be in love
when you only want me have as much
Oh it hurts to be in love
I tell you it hurts
Oh it hurts
Maybe it hurts
And it hurts
