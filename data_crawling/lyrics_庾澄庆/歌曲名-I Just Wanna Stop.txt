When I think about those night in Montreal

I'd give the sweetest stars for you and me

Memories of love above the city lights

Oh I try so hard to take it

Oh, the Lord, my heart won't make it

I just wanna stop and tell you what I feel about you
I just wanna stop, I never wanna live without you

I just gotta stop for your love, for your love

When I think about the way the world must turn （world must turn）

I give saddest stars for you and me （you and me）
Memories of love and times they go on and on

Oh it took so long to make it
But, the Lord, my mind won't blame it

I just wanna stop and tell you what I feel about you babe
I just wanna stop, the world aren't right without you babe
I just gotta stop for your love

Oh I tried so hard to take it

Oh, the Lord, my heart won't make it

I just wanna stop and tell you what I feel about you babe
I just wanna stop, I never wanna live without you babe
I just gotta stop for your love

I just wanna stop and tell you what I feel about you babe
I just wanna stop, the world isn't right without you babe
I just gotta stop

I just wanna stop

I just wanna stop and tell you what I feel about you babe
I just wanna stop, the world isn't right without you babe
I just wanna stop
