庾澄庆 - Is it you
Someone's just outside and knocking on my door

A stranger, somebody unknow

Someone's in my dreams, can't get it off my mind

I'm tired of being alone

Someone's trying to find an easy way inside

Come on, I'm right here at home, right at home

Is it you?

Is it you?

Is it you?

Is it you?

You? You?

Who's that deep inside me, stickin' around my heart

Are you somebody to love?

Show me what you're doing and tell me who you are

Hey, I'm ready for love, for love

Is it you?

Is it you?

Is it you?

Is it you?

You? You?

If it's you, come out in the open

You don't need to hide your love

And it's you, you know I'm hoping

Cause it's way too late to run away,
Don't run away from love my love

Is it you?

Is it you?

Is it you?

Is it you?

You? You?

Is it you?
Knocking on my door

Or is it my imagination, is it you?

I can't get it off my mind, is it you?

You? You?

Is it you?

Or is it my imagination

Is it you?

I can't get out off my mind

Is it you
