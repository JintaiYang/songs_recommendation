LOVE IS LOVE
庾澄庆

You don't have to touch it to know
Love is everywhere that you go
You don't have to touch it to feel
Love is every second we steal
Love is love is nothing without you
Love is love is everything you do
Open up your eyes and you will see
Love is love is everything to me
（music）
You don't have to touch it to be
Wrapped up in a motion I need
Every one must feel how I do
Love is just a because to you *
And you know that love is love
It's written in black and blue
And everything you say must bring her Closer'
closer to you Ba la ba Ba la ba Ba la ba
Love is love is nothing without you
Love is love is everything you do
Love is love
