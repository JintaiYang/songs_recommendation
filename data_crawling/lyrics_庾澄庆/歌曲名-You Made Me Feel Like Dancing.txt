You've got a cute way of talking
 You've got the better of me
 Just snap your fingers and I'm walking
 Like a dog hanging on your lead
 
 I'm in a apin you know　Shaking on the string you know
 You make me feel like dancing (I want to dance the night away)
 You make me feel like dancing (I'm gotta dance the night away)
 You make me feel like dancing
 I feel like dancing, dancing, dancing the night away
 I feel like dancing, dancing~~ oh
 
 Rockin' to four in the morning
 Ain't feeling tired no, no, no, no, no
 Just hold me tight and leave on the light
 Cause I don't want to go home
 You put a spell on me
 I'm right where you wamt me to be
 
 I'm in a apin you know　Shaking on the string you know
 You make me feel like dancing (I want to dance the night away)
 You make me feel like dancing (I want to dance the night away)
 You make me feel like dancing
 I feel like dancing, dancing, dancing the night away
 I feel like dancing, dancing~~ oh
 
 You make me higher　(I want to catch your fire...)
 
 You make me feel like dancing　(I want to dance the night away)
 (Repeat 2 time)
 You make me feel like dancing
 I feel like dancing, dancing
 Dance the night away
 (Let's rock!)(let's remix it)
 
 you've really slipped me a potion　I can't get off the floor
 All this prtpetual motion
 You gotta give me some more　You gotta gvie me some more
 And if you let me stay
 We'll dance　our lives away
 
 You make me feel like dancing　I want to dance my life away
