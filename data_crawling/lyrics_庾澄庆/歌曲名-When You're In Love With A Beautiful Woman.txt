When you're in love with a beautiful woman　 It's hard
 When you're in love with a beautiful woman　 You know it's hard
 Everybody wants her　Everybody loves her
 Everybody wants to take your baby home
 
 When you're in love with a beautiful woman　 You watch your friends
 When you're in love with a beautiful woman　 You never for lies
 Cause everybody tempts her　Everybody tells her
 She's he most beautiful woman they know
 When you're in love with a beautiful woman　 You got it alone
 
 Maybe just an ego problem
 Problem is I've been fooled before
 But fair weather friends and faint hearted lovers
 And everytime it happens　It just convinces me more
 
 When you're in love with a beautiful woman　 You watch your friends
 When you're in love with a beautiful woman　 It never ends
 When you're in love with a beautiful woman　 You watch her eyes
 When you're in love with a beautiful woman　 I'll look for lies
