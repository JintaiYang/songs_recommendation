meet you by surprise
i didn't realize
that my life would change forever
saw you standing there
i didn't know i cared
there waw something special in the air
dreams are my reality
the only kind of real fantasy
illusions are a common thing
i try to live in dreams
it seems as if it's meant to be
dreams are my reality
a different knind of reality
i dream of loving in the night
and loving seems alright
although it's only fantasy
if you do exist honey don't resist
show me a new way of loving
show me what to do
tell me that it's true
i feel something special about you

dreams are my reality
the only knid of reality

may be my foolishness has past
and may be now at last
i'll see how a real thing can be
dreams are my reality
a wonderous world where i like to be
i dream of holding you all night

perhaps that's my reality
met you by surprise i didn't realize
that my life would change forever
tell me that's true feelings that are cue
i feel something special about you
dreams are my reality
a wonderous world when i like to be
illusions are a common thing
try to live in dreams
although it's ony fantasy
dreams are my reality
i like to dream of your close to me
i dream of loving in the night
and loving you seems right
perhaps that's my reality
