I know you love me
You know I love you too
You know I always will
No matter what you do
Say you haven't got another lover
Say you only want to make the scene
Then you try to keep it under cover
What does that mean?
Oh baby, I can't stand still （while he's holding you）
I can't stand still （while he's kissing you）

How to put together love and work
If I could figure out that one. darlin'
I could save us from a world of hurt
I remember when we walked together
Makin' love on a summer night
Guess we thought that it would last forever
We were all right
Oh baby. I can't stand still （while he's holding you）
I can't stand still （while he's kissing you）
I can take it if you need some freedom
Understand it if you miss your friends
Don't you ever try to think of me some
You never tell me where you've been
Say you haven't got another lover
Say you only want to make the scene
Then you try to keep it under cover
What does that mean?
Oh baby, I can't stand still （while he's holding you）
I can't stand still （while he's kissing you）
Oh baby, I can't stand still （while he's holding you）
I can't stand still （while he's kissing you）
