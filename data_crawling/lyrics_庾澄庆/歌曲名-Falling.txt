When I was with her
And the snow was falling down
Warmed by the fire
And not veing by her
When there's no one else around
And
I'm falling
Oh, I'm falling
I'm falling in love with you
I think about summer
My head was swimming
You wrote my name in the sand
We walked together hoping forever
Please don't let go of my hand
I'm falling
Oh, I'm falling
I'm falling in love with you
Fall and the spring time
Like in between times
You're here and then you're gone away
Oh, I just wanted to say
Won't you please please stay
Oh, falling
Oh, falling
And
I'm falling
Oh, I'm falling
I'm falling in love with you
