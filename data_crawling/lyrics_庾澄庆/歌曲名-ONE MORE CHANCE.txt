My love for you will never die
I found in you my dream come true

Half of my life
spent just waiting for tomorrow
Wandering why
My days were filled with sorrow
You came along
Showed me why my heart was aching
Opened my eyes
to the love I'd been forsaking
Now you say you're leaving

My love for you will never die
I found in you my dream come true

Deep in my heart
I know I'll never find another
Another love
like the one we gave each other
Used to believe
We would always be together
Until you said love can never last forever
Now you want to leave

If you feel that I'm mistreating you
If I've let you down
Can't we stop and talk it out
Girl, I'm begging you to give me just one more chance




My love for you will never die
I found in you my dream come true
