You are the sunshine baby when ever you smile
But I call you stormy today
All of a sudden that old rains falling down
And my world is cloudy and gray
You've gone away
Oh stormy　Oh stormy　 Oh stormy　Oh stormy
Yesterday's Love was like a warm summer breeze
But like the weather changed
Our thimgs are dreary baby windy and cold
And I stand alone in the rain
Calling out your name
Oh stormy　Oh stormy　 Oh stormy　Oh stormy
Bring back that sunny day
Yesterday's Love was like a warm summer breeze
But like the weather changed
Everything around is dreary (windy and cold) Oh so cold
I stand alone in the rain
Calling out your name
Ohh...stormy　Come back to me
Yeh...stormy baby stormy　Come back to me
Bring back that sunny day
