When I think about your lovinâ€²
And the starry evenings that we used to share
Looking through the memories in my mind

Since I've laughed and cried and thought it over
Now I realize that it's never over only set aside

Oh it's you sweet baby

I will never be free from your embrace
Sweet baby

Only hoping it's not too late to try again
It's you sweet baby
ever lost and captured by your smile

Sweet baby

I will always be right there by your side

Right by your side

Lying here alone
I'm dreaming my mind keeps wandering
My thoughes are only you
Wandering through the memories in my mind

How could love so real have turned so empty
I just keep wondering why

Will I ever find the love we shared together you and I

Oh it's you sweet baby

though we've had such a long hard road to climb

Sweet baby

Only hoping it's not too late to try again
It's you sweet baby

Won't you try and believe in what I say

Sweet baby

I will always be right there by your side

Right by your side

Oh it's you sweet baby

I will always be right there by your side

Sweet baby

Only hoping it's not too late to try again
It's you sweet baby

ever lost and captured by your smile

Sweet baby

I will always be right there by your side

Right by your side
