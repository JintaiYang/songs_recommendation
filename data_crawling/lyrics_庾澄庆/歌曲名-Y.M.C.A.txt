young man, there's no need to feel down.
I said, young man, pick yourself off the ground.
I said, young man, 'cause you're in a new town
there's no need to be unhappy.
young man, there's a place you can go.
I said, young man, when you're short on your dough.
you can stay there, and I'm sure you will find
many ways to have a good time.
it's fun to stay at the y-m-c-a.
it's fun to stay at the y-m-c-a.
they have everything for you men to enjoy,
you can hang out with all the boys ...
it's fun to stay at the y-m-c-a.
it's fun to stay at the y-m-c-a.
you can get yourself cleaned, you can have a good meal,
you can do whatever you feel ...
young man, are you listening to me?
I said, young man, what do you want to be?
I said, young man, you can make real your dreams.
but you got to know this one thing!
no man does it all by himself.
I said, young man, put your pride on the shelf,
and just go there, to the y.m.c.a.
I'm sure they can help you today.

young man, I was once in your shoes.
I said, I was down and out with the blues.
I felt no man cared if I were alive.
I felt the whole world was so tight ...
that's when someone came up to me,
and said, young man, take a walk up the street.
there's a place there called the y.m.c.a.
they can start you back on your way.
it's fun to stay at the y-m-c-a.
it's fun to stay at the y-m-c-a.
they have everything for you men to enjoy,
you can hang out with all the boys ...
y-m-c-a ... you'll find it at the y-m-c-a.
