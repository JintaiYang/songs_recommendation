上海国际田径黄金大奖赛主题曲
阳光下我寻找节奏
oh 抬起头
追求那自由
每一次呼喊着加油
突破极限后
挥手的怒吼
hey you 拼搏是为什么理由
Just tell me the reason you feel
胜利不可强求
and want you know
hey you I never want you say you quit baby
我知道自信是赢的魔咒
就算跌倒也不放手
and want you know
run forever
to be the winner
and you know what you do just to do
and want you know
run forever
to be the winner
and you know what you do just to do
and want you know
谁能将我们左右
速度是信念的追求
不管成功与否
and want you know
谁能将我们左右
速度是梦想的追求
不管成功与否
and want you know

阳光下我寻找节奏
