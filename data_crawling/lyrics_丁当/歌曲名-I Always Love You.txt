If I should stay, I'll only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know I'll
Think of you every step of the way
And I will always love you
I will always love you
Bittersweet memories
That is all I'm taking with me
So, goodbye
Please, don't cry
We both know I'm not what you, you need
but I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of
And I wish to you, joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love
And I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
