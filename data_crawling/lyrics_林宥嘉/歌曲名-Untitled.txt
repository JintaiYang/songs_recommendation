Will you be my lover?
Will you be the one?
Will you be like no other?
For how long?
Oh yes I'll be your wild flower
Grown through the concrete street
And born to the backbeats of the stars
And yes I'm just a stupid guy
Crushed like a butterfly
Dead-eyed at the drive-by
In a car
And like flies on a windscreen
And like insects in glue
We could stick together
If you wanted to
And yes I'll be your wild flower
Grown through the concrete street
And born to the backbeats of the stars
And yes I'm just a stupid guy
Crushed like a butterfly
Dead-eyed at the drive-by
In a car
