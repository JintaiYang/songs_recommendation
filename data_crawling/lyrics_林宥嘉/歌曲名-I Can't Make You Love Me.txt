Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices
Inside my head
Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me close
Don't patronize
Don't patronize me
I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Somethin' that it wont
Here in the dark in these final hours
I will lay down my heart
And I will feel the power but you won't
No you won't
Cause I can't make you love me
I'll close my eyes
'Cause then I won't see
The love you don't feel
When you're holdin' me
Morning will come
And I do what's right
Just give me till then
To give up this fight
And I will give up this fight
'Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Somethin' that it wont
Here in the dark in these final hours
I will lay down my heart
I will feel the power but you won't
No you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me
