I'm singing in the rain
Just singing in the rain
What a glorious feeling
I'm happy again

I'm laughing at clouds
So dark up above
The sun's in my heart
And I'm ready for love, for love

Let the stormy clouds chase
Everyone from the place
Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face

I walk down the lane
With a happy refrain
Singing, singing in the rain
In the rain

I'm singing in the rain
Just singing in the rain
What a glorious feeling
I've a smile on my face

I walk down the lane
With a happy refrain
I'm singing, singing in the rain
In the rain
In the rain
