Why is my heart
so bothered by the spring wind
It’s a mystery I can’t explain
Cold cold night
Rain drops in black and white
Looking back it feels like a dream
The picture remains caught in a frame
How, how can I get through
Find a way to see through yesterday’s blues
Cos I, I could never see you
like how others see you
As Yesterday’s News
啊 不怕相思苦 只怕妳伤痛
怨只怨人在风中 聚散都不由我
Cos I, I could never see you
like how others see you
As Yesterday’s News
