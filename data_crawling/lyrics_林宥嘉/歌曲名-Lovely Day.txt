When I wake up in the morning love
Sunlight hurts my eyes
Something without warning love
Bears heavy on my mind

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
It's gonna be a lovely day
A lovely day

When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be, gonna be
A lovely day
A lovely day
A lovely day
It's gonna be a lovely day
It's gonna be a lovely day
