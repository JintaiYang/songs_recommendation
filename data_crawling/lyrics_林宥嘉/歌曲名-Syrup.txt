Once upon, a sunny day
You made an oath for this love

I never tried believing
If you'd ever stray from this love

Never dare to leave me
If you did, you did for this love

This I know, I know it so
Though I can't bare to be provoked
Oh I know you're a sweet good girl

The best in all the world

Baby please, and baby please we can get down

We can get down

Sorry once again

Baby please, and baby please we can get down

We can get down

Sorry once again

Though you've gone, go on and try be with
Anybody else
But, no one will ever love you
They will see you through and through

Oh I know you're a sweet good girl

The best in all the world

Baby please, and baby please we can get down

We can get down

Sorry once again

Baby please, and baby please we can get down

You'll come around

Sorry once again

You're my sweet good girl

The best in all the world

Baby please, and baby please we can get down

We can get down

Sorry once again

Baby please, and baby please we can get down

You'll come around

Or you'll be sorry, sorry once again
Na na na .....

Sorry once

Na na na ......

Sorry once again, once once once again
